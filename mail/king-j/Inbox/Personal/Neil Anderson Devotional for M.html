The Fleshly Person<br>
<br>
I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet<br>
able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for<br>
you are still fleshly. (1 Corinthians 3: 2,3).<br>
<br>
The spirit of the fleshly person is identical to that of the<br>
spiritual person. The fleshly person is a Christian, spiritually<br>
alive in Christ and declared righteous by God. But that's where<br>
the similarity ends. Instead of being directed by the Spirit,<br>
this believer chooses to follow the impulses of his flesh. As a<br>
result, his mind is occupied by carnal thoughts and his emotions<br>
are plagued by negative feelings. And though he is free to choose<br>
to walk after the Spirit and produce the fruit of the Spirit, he<br>
continues to involve himself in sinful activity by willfully<br>
walking after the flesh.<br>
<br>
His physical body is a temple of God, but he is using it as an<br>
instrument of unrighteousness. He has the same troubling physical<br>
symptoms experienced by the natural person because he is not<br>
operating in the manner God created him to operate. He is not<br>
presenting his body to God as a living sacrifice. Since he yields<br>
to the flesh instead of crucifying it, the fleshly man is also<br>
subject to feelings of inferiority, insecurity, inadequacy,<br>
guilt, worry, and doubt.<br>
<br>
Several years ago I did some research to discover how many<br>
Christians are still the victims of their flesh. I asked the same<br>
question to 50 consecutive Christians who came to me to talk<br>
about problems in their lives: &quot;How many of the following<br>
characteristics describe your life: inferiority, insecurity,<br>
inadequacy, guilt, worry, and doubt:&quot; Every one of the 50<br>
answered, &quot;All six.&quot; Here were 50 born-again, righteous children<br>
of God who were so bogged down by the flesh that they struggled<br>
with the same problems of self-doubt which inundate unbelivers<br>
who only live in the flesh.<br>
<br>
If I asked you the same question, how would you answer? I imagine<br>
that many of you would admit that some or all of these six traits<br>
describe you. It is evident to me that a staggering number of<br>
believers are still confused about their spiritual identity in<br>
Christ and its implications for their daily lives. We are<br>
struggling with the behavior aspect of our growth because we are<br>
still struggling with the belief aspect of our growth: who we are<br>
in Christ.<br>
<br>
Father, help me live above my fleshly desires today by exercising<br>
my spiritual inheritance at every temptation.<br>

The Door of Full Surrender<br>
<br>
But He knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I will<br>
come forth as gold.<br>
- (Job 23:10)<br>
<br>
<br>
I was recently sitting with the leader of a marketplace<br>
organization as he described a question he poses to<br>
businesspeople. &quot;What if there were two doors to choose from;<br>
behind one door was the complete will of God for your life and<br>
behind the other door was how life could be according to your own<br>
preference. Which door would you choose?&quot; The struggle for most<br>
lies in the desire to follow God completely and the fear of what<br>
might be behind the door of full surrender. Most of us desire to<br>
follow God, but few of us will do it at any cost. We do not<br>
really believe that God loves us to the degree that we are<br>
willing to give Him complete permission to do as He wills in us.<br>
<br>
If we desire to fully walk with Christ, there is a cost. We may<br>
give intellectual assent and go along with His principles and do<br>
fine; however, if we are fully given over to Him and His will for<br>
our life, it will be a life that will have adversity. The Bible<br>
is clear that humans do not achieve greatness without having<br>
their sinful will broken. This process is designed to create a<br>
nature change in each of us, not just a habit change. The Bible<br>
calls it circumcision. Circumcision is painful, bloody, and<br>
personal.<br>
<br>
If God has plans to greatly use you in the lives of others, you<br>
can expect your trials to be even greater than those of others.<br>
Why? Because, like Joseph who went through greater trials than<br>
most patriarchs, your calling may have such responsibility that<br>
God cannot afford to entrust it to you without ensuring your<br>
complete faithfulness to the call. He has much invested in you on<br>
behalf of others. He may want to speak through your life to a<br>
greater degree than through another. The events of your life<br>
would become the frame for the message He wants to speak through<br>
you.<br>
<br>
Do not fear the path that God may lead you on. Embrace it. For<br>
God may bring you down a path in your life to ensure the reward<br>
of your inheritance. &quot;For our light and momentary troubles are<br>
achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all&quot; (2<br>
Cor. 4:17).<br>

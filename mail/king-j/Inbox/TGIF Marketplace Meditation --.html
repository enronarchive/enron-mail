Coming Out of Babylon<br>
<br>
...&quot;Come out of her, My people, so that you will not share in her<br>
sins, sso that you will not receive any of her plagues; for her<br>
sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.&quot;<br>
- (Revelation 18:4)<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a day when God is going to judge the system of Babylon<br>
around the world. What is Babylon? Babylon is a system of doing<br>
business. The stronghold of the marketplace is mammon and pride.<br>
Dependence on money and misplaced trust are at the core of a<br>
Babylonian philosophy of life. Revelation 18 describes a time<br>
when God will judge this Babylonian system. It is the one place<br>
that we see a system destroyed in one day, even one hour. I do<br>
not believe Babylon is a particular city, but a world system.<br>
&quot;Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her&quot; (Rev.<br>
18:8a). &quot;Woe! Woe, O great city, O Babylon, city of power! In one<br>
hour your doom has come!&quot; (Rev. 18:10b).<br>
<br>
As Christian businesspeople we are called to acknowledge the<br>
signs of the times. When the Soviet Union fell, many knew it was<br>
going to happen because they could recognize the signs of the<br>
times. God has a way of shaking things up. These shakings force<br>
us to determine who and what we will place our trust in. God says<br>
that we are to &quot;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and<br>
with all your soul and with all your mind&quot; (Mt. 22:37).<br>
<br>
Are you still living in Babylon in the way you do business? If<br>
so, expect to share in the sins of Babylon when God decides to<br>
judge her. Ask God to show you where you might be operating in a<br>
&quot;Babylonian&quot; system of work.<br>

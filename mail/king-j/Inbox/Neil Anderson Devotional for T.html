THE SHIELD OF FAITH<br>
<br>
Taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to<br>
extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one (Ephesians<br>
6:16).<br>
<br>
Paul mentions three more pieces of armor that we must take up to<br>
protect ourselves from Satan's attack: the shield of faith, the<br>
helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit which is the<br>
Word of God. The first three (the belt of truth, the breastplate<br>
of righteousness, the shoes of peace) are established by our<br>
position in Christ; these last three help us continue to win the<br>
battle.<br>
<br>
Contrary to popular perception, there is nothing mystical about<br>
faith. Biblical faith is simply what you believe about God and<br>
His Word. The more you know about God and His Word, the more<br>
faith you will have. The less you know, the smaller your shield<br>
will be and the easier it will be for one of Satan's fiery darts<br>
to reach its target. If you want your shield of faith to grow<br>
large and protective, your knowledge of God and His Word must<br>
increase (Romans 10:17).<br>
<br>
These flaming missiles from Satan are nothing more than<br>
smoldering lies, burning accusations, and fiery temptations<br>
bombarding our minds. When a deceptive thought, accusation, or<br>
temptation enters your mind, meet it head-on with what you know<br>
to be true about God and His Word. How did Jesus deflect the<br>
missiles of Satan's temptation? By shielding Himself with<br>
statements from the Word of God. Every time you memorize a Bible<br>
verse, listen to a sermon, or participate in a Bible study, you<br>
increase your knowledge of God and enlarge your shield of faith.<br>
<br>
We all struggle with tempting and accusing thoughts. If you are a<br>
healthy and mature Christian, they will bounce right off your<br>
shield of faith.<br>
<br>
Lord, I raise up the shield of faith today and stand against<br>
tempting and accusing thoughts from the evil one.<br>

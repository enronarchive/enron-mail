Subject: Load Forecasting Technology<br>
<br>
<br>
To whom it may concern:<br>
<br>
My name is Craig Carmichael.  I am a PhD student at Iowa State<br>
University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab. <br>
Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power<br>
traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron<br>
millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose<br>
success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I<br>
believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am<br>
way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go<br>
somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.<br>
<br>
Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be<br>
promising to read the remainder of this email.<br>
<br>
   1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.<br>
   2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning<br>
techniques.<br>
   2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the<br>
Chicago area for ComEd.<br>
   3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of<br>
this.<br>
   4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.<br>
   5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy<br>
Associates in Atlanta.<br>
   6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS<br>
future v5.0<br>
   7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training<br>
engine (not yet released)<br>
   8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced<br>
inductive learning methods.<br>
<br>
This is the situation:<br>
<br>
   I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced<br>
forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural<br>
network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at<br>
ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The<br>
models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using<br>
the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those<br>
that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have<br>
been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary<br>
studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything<br>
that is available at any price.<br>
<br>
   Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have<br>
awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that<br>
I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the<br>
Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting). <br>
This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke<br>
even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they<br>
work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors<br>
appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.<br>
<br>
John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he<br>
tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd,<br>
Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project<br>
manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software<br>
for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.<br>
<br>
Ok.  Here are the possibilities.<br>
<br>
   1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading<br>
forecasting technology<br>
   2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about<br>
   3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock<br>
all by himself<br>
   4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as<br>
well send him a data set to test his claims.<br>
<br>
<br>
I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I<br>
don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my<br>
technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense<br>
asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of<br>
your in-house modeling efforts.<br>
<br>
Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am<br>
making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and<br>
ability to sell you their gem.<br>
<br>
What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can<br>
do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not<br>
disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and<br>
companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will<br>
show you flaws in other &quot;gems&quot;.<br>
<br>
I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family &amp; I, as of now, have a<br>
fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have<br>
a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what<br>
opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in<br>
convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will<br>
go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the<br>
leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or<br>
form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.<br>
<br>
Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic<br>
for sending you this lengthy email.<br>

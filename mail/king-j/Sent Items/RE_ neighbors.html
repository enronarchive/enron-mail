Good morning to you.  Sonny P. said they were in Houston this  weekend because Stan/Staci had moved into a new house.  I told him so did  you.  He sent this reply.  Hope you have a good day and have a  happy Thanksgiving tomorrow.  I love you!<br>

Yes, you have to make  reservations when you go to Huntsville State Park.....its a very nice  place.....we are staying here Thanksgivning...well, we are having a Hardee  family reunion at the civic center in Poynor....Patti and family are here  now....Stan moved near Beltway 8 and I10......in the Spring Branch Memorial  school district......off Gessner.,,.12330 Old Oaks St.  You take the Toll  Road Beltway 8 to the west and get off on I10 and and go towards the city and  stay on the feeder road about 1/2 mile and get off on Gessner...and go about 4  blocks to Old Oaks.  Sounds like its not too far from Jeff....they need to  give each other a holler...Stans work number is 713-228-6601 and home number  713-467-6754.  You might want to forward this to Jeff....if you do...then    HI JEFF...bet you could not hit one as far as you did in Big Sandy  that time...hahahhaa <br>

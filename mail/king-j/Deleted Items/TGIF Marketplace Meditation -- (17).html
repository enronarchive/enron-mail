The Dangers of Overcontrol<br>
<br>
For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like<br>
the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the<br>
Lord, He has rejected you as king.<br>
- (1 Samuel 15:23)<br>
<br>
<br>
A friend of mine who is a jet pilot once told me that whenever a<br>
jet goes out of control and begins to spin, the only thing to do<br>
is totally take your hands off the controls and the plane will<br>
right itself. This goes against our natural inclination to<br>
control and manipulate in order to bring things back under<br>
control. It is scary to be out of control. Or is it?<br>
<br>
Saul was a man out of control. He was losing control of his<br>
kingdom to David. He was losing the favor of God and the people.<br>
It began as compromises. Eventually he was given a final test to<br>
obey the voice of God fully. He was instructed to kill the<br>
Amalekites completely; but he failed to follow through. The<br>
prophet Samuel delivered a hard word to King Saul, &quot;Because you<br>
have rejected the word of the Lord, He has rejected you as king&quot;<br>
(see 1 Sam. 15:26). Saul obeyed partially, but not fully. It was<br>
partial obedience that led to his removal as king of Israel and<br>
his calling from God. But why did Saul do such a thing? &quot;I was<br>
afraid of the people and so I gave in to them&quot; (1 Sam. 15:24b).<br>
Saul's fear and insecurity made him more afraid of the people and<br>
what they thought than of God. At the core of Saul's disobedience<br>
was fear of losing control. That fear of losing control led to<br>
partial obedience and the loss of his reign as king.<br>
<br>
How many of us are in danger of losing God's blessing due to<br>
partial obedience? How many of us have such a need to control<br>
people and circumstances that we fail to fully walk in obedience<br>
to God's voice in our lives? Saul provides a great lesson for us<br>
as businesspeople. The need to overcontrol things around us can<br>
prevent us from receiving all that God has for us. Today, take an<br>
inventory of your control quotient.<br>
<br>
Ask God if you are being fully obedient to what He has called you<br>
to do this day, and avoid being put on the shelf for<br>
disobedience. &quot;To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is<br>
better than the fat of rams&quot; (1 Sam. 15:22b).<br>

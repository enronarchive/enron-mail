PROPHETIC MESSAGES<br>
<br>
&quot;Is not My word like fire?&quot; declares the LORD, and like a hammer<br>
which shatters a rock?&quot; (Jeremiah 23:29).<br>
<br>
If you attend a Christian fellowship where prophecies are part of<br>
public worship, I wonder if we should expect from God generic<br>
messages like, &quot;I love you, My children&quot; or &quot;I'm coming soon.&quot;<br>
These statements are certainly true, but why would they need to<br>
be prophesied, since the Bible already clearly asserts God's love<br>
and Christ's imminent return? I have heard &quot;prophecies&quot; like<br>
these given in churches where many people were living in sin,<br>
lulling them into an unrighteous complacency.<br>
<br>
The voice of a prophet is a consuming fire and a shattering<br>
hammer. A prophetic message should motivate people to<br>
righteousness, not placate them in their sin (1 Peter 4:17). God<br>
is more concerned about church purity than about church growth.<br>
Comfort only comes to those who are persecuted for righteousness'<br>
sake by allowing God's Word to purge their sin and shatter their<br>
self-centeredness.<br>
<br>
Jeremiah relates two other evidences of false prophets: &quot;'Behold,<br>
I am against the prophets,' declares the LORD, 'who steal My<br>
words from each other'&quot; (23:30). That's plagiarism: taking what<br>
God gave someone else and using it as if it were your own. &quot;'I am<br>
against the prophets,' declares the LORD, 'who use their tongues<br>
and declare, &quot;the Lord declares&quot;'&quot; (verse 31).<br>
<br>
Declaring that what you are saying is directly from the Lord when<br>
it isn't is an incredible offense to God. If God wants me to know<br>
something He will tell me directly. I believe in the priesthood<br>
of believers; however, God can and will encourage us and confirm<br>
His Word to us through others. &quot;There is one God, and one<br>
mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus&quot; (1<br>
Timothy 2:5). If someone says to you &quot;God told me to tell you . .<br>
.&quot; that person may be functioning as a medium. The gift of<br>
prophecy should reveal the secrets of the heart so people will<br>
fall on their faces and worship God (1 Corinthians 14:25). Then<br>
God will guide them by His Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
Lord, teach me not to quench Your Spirit nor to despise prophetic<br>
utterances but to examine everything and hold fast to what is<br>
good.<br>

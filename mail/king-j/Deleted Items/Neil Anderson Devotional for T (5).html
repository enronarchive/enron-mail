<br>
A NEW CREATURE<br>
<br>
Therefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old<br>
things passed away; behold, new things have come (2 Corinthians<br>
5:17).<br>
<br>
Dan and Cindy were a fine young Christian couple who were<br>
preparing for ministry on the mission field. Then tragedy struck:<br>
Cindy was raped. As hard as she tried to get back to normal life,<br>
Cindy couldn't shake the horrible memories and feelings from her<br>
experience.<br>
<br>
Six months after the tragedy, Dan and Cindy attended a church<br>
conference where I was speaking. During the conference Cindy<br>
called me in tears. &quot;Neil, I know God can turn everything into<br>
good, but how is He going to do that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait a minute, Cindy,&quot; I said. &quot;God will work everything out for<br>
good, but He doesn't make a bad thing good. What happened to you<br>
was evil. God's good thing is to show you how you can walk<br>
through your crisis and come out of it a better person.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But I just can't separate myself from my experience,&quot; she<br>
sobbed. &quot;I've been raped, Neil, and I'll be a victim of that all<br>
my life.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Cindy,&quot; I insisted. &quot;The rape happened to you, but it hasn't<br>
changed who you are, nor does it have to control you. You were<br>
the victim of a terrible, ugly tragedy. But if you only see<br>
yourself as a rape victim for the rest of your life, you will<br>
never be free. You're a child of God. You can't fix the past, but<br>
you can be free from it.&quot;<br>
<br>
All of us have a number of hurtful, traumatic experiences in our<br>
past which have scarred us emotionally. You may have grown up<br>
with a physically, emotionally or sexually abusive parent. Any<br>
number of traumatic, emotional events can clutter your soul with<br>
emotional baggage which seems to limit your maturity and block<br>
your freedom in Christ. You must renounce the experiences and<br>
lies that have controlled you and forgive those who have offended<br>
you.<br>
<br>
As a Christian, you are primarily the product of the work of<br>
Christ on the cross. You are literally a new creature in Christ.<br>
The &quot;old you&quot; is gone; the &quot;new you&quot; is here.<br>
<br>
Father, thank You for working all things for good in my life,<br>
even the effects of evil attacks meant for my harm and<br>
destruction.<br>

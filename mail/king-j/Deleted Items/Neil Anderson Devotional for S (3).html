LIVING WITH SIN'S CONSEQUENCES<br>
<br>
Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the<br>
wrath of God, for it is written, &quot;Vengeance is Mine, I will<br>
repay,&quot; says the Lord (Romans 12:19).<br>
<br>
Forgiveness does not mean that you must tolerate sin. Isabel, a<br>
young wife and mother attending one of my conferences, told me of<br>
her decision to forgive her mother for continually manipulating<br>
her for attention. But Isabel tearfully continued, &quot;She is no<br>
different. Am I supposed to let her keep ruining my life?&quot;<br>
<br>
No, forgiving someone doesn't mean that you must be a doormat to<br>
their continual sin. I encouraged Isabel to confront her mother<br>
lovingly but firmly, and tell her that she would no longer<br>
tolerate destructive manipulation. It's okay to forgive another's<br>
past sins and, at the same time, take a stand against future<br>
sins. Forgiving is not a co-dependent activity.<br>
<br>
Forgiveness does not demand revenge or repayment for offenses<br>
suffered. &quot;You mean I'm just supposed to let them off the hook?&quot;<br>
you may argue. Yes, you let them off your hook, realizing that<br>
they are not off God's hook. You may feel like exacting justice,<br>
but you are not an impartial judge. God is the just Judge who<br>
will make everything right (Romans 12:19). Your job is to extend<br>
the mercy of forgiveness and leave judgment up to God.<br>
<br>
Forgiveness is agreeing to live with the consequences of another<br>
person's sin. Suppose that someone in your church says, &quot;I have<br>
gossiped about you. Will you forgiven me?&quot; You can't retract<br>
gossip any easier than you can put toothpaste back into the tube.<br>
You're going to live with the gossip this person spread about you<br>
no matter how you respond to the gossiper.<br>
<br>
We are all living with the consequences of another person's sin:<br>
Adam's. The only real choice we have in the matter is to live in<br>
the bondage of bitterness or in the freedom of forgiveness.<br>
<br>
Heavenly Father, I give up my right to seek revenge or harbor<br>
resentment. I want to enjoy the freedom which comes from<br>
forgiving others.<br>

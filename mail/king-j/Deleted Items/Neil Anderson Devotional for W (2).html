November 21<br>
<br>
LORD, TOUCH ME<br>
<br>
Then again He laid His hands upon his eyes; and he looked<br>
intently and was restored, and began to see everything clearly<br>
(Mark 8:25).<br>
<br>
One of the greatest personal crises I have faced in the ministry<br>
revolved around the issue of forgiveness and a board member. I<br>
struggled relating to this man, and I knew that I couldn't<br>
continue on the way things were. So I decided to resign my<br>
pastorate.<br>
<br>
The week before I was going to read my resignation to the<br>
congregation, I got sick. I was flat on my back with a<br>
temperature of 103.5 and I totally lost my voice. It was easy to<br>
recognize that God wasn't pleased with my decision. I began<br>
reading the Gospels and came upon Mark 8:22-26 where Jesus healed<br>
the blind man. I noticed that after Jesus' first touch, the man<br>
said, &quot;I see men . . . like trees&quot; (verse 24). I suddenly<br>
realized that I saw this man like that: a big tree, an obstacle<br>
blocking my path.<br>
<br>
Then Jesus touched the blind man again and he began to see people<br>
clearly, not as trees. I got the message. &quot;Lord, I don't love<br>
this man. I know You do, and I want to. But You will have to<br>
touch me like You did that blind man. Lord, I need You to touch<br>
me so I can be the person You want me to be.&quot; And God did! I<br>
chose at that moment to forgive the man completely.<br>
<br>
The next Sunday I went to church, not to resign, but to preach.<br>
My voice was still so husky that I almost couldn't speak. I<br>
confessed to the congregation my own independence and my desire<br>
for the Lord to touch me, to see people as people, not as<br>
obstacles to my goals. At the end of the sermon, I invited anyone<br>
who desired a touch from the Lord to join me at the altar. Soon<br>
the altar area and the aisles in the front were packed with<br>
people. Eventually all but a few people had come forward. It was<br>
a revival!<br>
<br>
Guess who was one of the few? To my knowledge he never changed,<br>
but I did. And I thank God to this day that He put me flat on my<br>
back to make me the pastor He wanted me to be. If I had had my<br>
way, I would probably be out of the ministry today.<br>
<br>
Lord, touch me today that I may love the difficult people in my<br>
life as You do.<br>

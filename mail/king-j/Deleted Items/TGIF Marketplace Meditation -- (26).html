Ability Versus Availability<br>
<br>
His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor His delight<br>
in the legs of a man; the Lord delights in those who fear Him,<br>
who put their hope in His unfailing love.<br>
- (Psalms 147:10-11)<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you ever feel so skilled in what you do that you require<br>
little help from others? Perhaps you may feel that you are more<br>
skilled than any other in your field. Does God need your skills<br>
and abilities in order to accomplish His purposes on this earth?<br>
The answer is NO.<br>
<br>
One thing God does not need is our skills and abilities. However,<br>
He does give us the privilege to exercise our gifts and abilities<br>
for His service. That service may be as a computer technician, a<br>
secretary, an ironworker, or even a lawyer. God calls each of us<br>
to our vocations to work unto Him. To believe that He needs our<br>
skills to accomplish His mission on earth would be to lower our<br>
understanding of an all-encompassing and all-powerful God. The<br>
psalmist tells us that His pleasure is not in our strength and<br>
ability, but His pleasure is in the attitude of the heart. It is<br>
what we find in the heart that helps determine whether ability is<br>
translated into availability. You see, God is looking to and fro<br>
throughout the earth for a man or woman who is fully committed to<br>
Him. A man or woman who is committed to fearing the Lord and<br>
placing his hope in His unfailing love is the person God seeks to<br>
support. &quot;For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to<br>
strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him&quot; (2<br>
Chron. 16:9a). When our agenda becomes His agenda, we can expect<br>
God to fully support all that we do.<br>
<br>
If we want to see our skills and abilities multiplied a<br>
hundredfold, then we must make them completely available to His<br>
service. Where are the opportunities in which God is calling you<br>
to be available to Him? Next time someone asks you to be involved<br>
in some activity, before you say yea or nay, make sure you check<br>
in with the Master of our decisions to ensure that your gifts and<br>
talents are being used as He desires.<br>

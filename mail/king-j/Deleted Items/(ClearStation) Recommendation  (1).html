	 Sun Oct 21 14:14:31 2001   AMRN a potential as a long.  case being that the 50-day EMA holds up during this pullback off late september spurt.     but might be early in terms of the cycle here : it is noteworthy that AMRN based for almost 2 months after the spurt in late july.  the pullback off the most recent spurt in late september is only about 3 weeks old.   a stop would be set on a break of the 50-day EMA, which would be about 18 bucks a share.     kensey  	<br>

Thirsting After God<br>
<br>
...&quot;Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit&quot;....<br>
- (2 Kings 2:9)<br>
<br>
<br>
The first requirement to move in greater power and authority in<br>
God is to hunger for it. Yet even this hunger is born from God.<br>
Elisha hungered after God. Elisha saw many miracles as Elijah's<br>
servant. But he wanted more. He wanted a double portion of<br>
Elijah's spirit. When he asked Elijah for this, the prophet<br>
responded, &quot;You have asked a difficult thing.&quot; It wasn't because<br>
it couldn't be granted. Elijah knew that with great anointing<br>
came a great weight of responsibility and difficulty.<br>
<br>
Second, humility comes before honor. Elisha was known as the<br>
&quot;servant of Elijah.&quot; How would you like to be known as &quot;the<br>
servant of John&quot;? Your name is not even mentioned. This was the<br>
preparation of Elisha. It has been the preparation of many men of<br>
God. Consider Joseph, the servant of Pharaoh. Consider David, the<br>
servant of Saul.<br>
<br>
Third, Elisha committed himself totally to his calling. The<br>
Scripture says when Elisha was called to join Elijah, the younger<br>
man left his farm business completely. He slaughtered his oxen<br>
and had a great feast for the community. It was all or nothing.<br>
He could not fall back on his farm trade if his new venture<br>
didn't work. This demonstrates Elisha's pioneer spirit in<br>
stepping out, not knowing what was ahead.<br>
<br>
Do you want greater anointing in God? &quot;You will seek Me and find<br>
Me when you seek Me with all your heart. I will be found by you&quot;<br>
(Jer. 29:13-14a). Begin thirsting for God's anointing in your<br>
heart today. This is the starting place.<br>

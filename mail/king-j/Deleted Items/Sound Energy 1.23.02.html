Hello Jeff King,<br>
<br>
RWR would like to welcome you again to our second edition of Sound Energy.  You will receive this publication on a free trial basis for the next 45 days.<br>
<br>
Every two weeks, we look at energy companies and sectors that strive to make energy more efficient or the environment cleaner.  These<br>
sectors include renewable energy (including wind and solar power),<br>
distributed generation (fuel cells and microturbines), and power<br>
semiconductors.<br>
<br>
This edition includes:<br>
- Feature Article:  Is Wind Still Blowing?  A closer look at the U.S. wind market.<br>
- Overview of renewables, distributed generation and power semiconductor sectors.<br>

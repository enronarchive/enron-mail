THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD<br>
<br>
Therefore, take up the full armor of God, that you may be able to<br>
resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm<br>
(Ephesians 6:13).<br>
<br>
A primary element in our protection from Satan and evil is the<br>
armor that God has provided for us and instructed us to put on in<br>
Ephesians 6:13-17. When we put on the armor of God, we are really<br>
putting on Christ (Romans 13:12-14). And when we put on Christ,<br>
we take ourselves out of the realm of the flesh, where we are<br>
vulnerable to attack, and we place ourselves within the dominion<br>
of Christ, where the evil one cannot touch us. Satan has nothing<br>
in Christ (John 14:30), and to the extent that we put on Christ,<br>
the evil one cannot touch us (1 John 5:18). He can only touch<br>
that which is on his own level. That's why we are commanded,<br>
&quot;Make no provision for the flesh&quot; (Romans 13:14), meaning &quot;Don't<br>
live on Satan's level.&quot;<br>
<br>
It would appear from the verb tenses in Ephesians 6;14, 15, that<br>
three of the pieces of armor--belt, breastplate and shoes--are<br>
already on you: &quot;having girded . . .&quot;; &quot;having put on . . .&quot;;<br>
having shod. . . .&quot; These pieces of armor represent the elements<br>
of your protection made possible when you receive Jesus Christ<br>
and in which you are commanded to stand firm. The Greek tense of<br>
&quot;having&quot; signifies that the action it refers to was completed<br>
before we were commanded to stand firm. That's the logical way a<br>
soldier would prepare for action: He would put on his belt,<br>
breastplate and shoes before attempting to stand firm. Likewise,<br>
we are to put on the full armor of God after having already put<br>
on Christ.<br>
<br>
When you read through Ephesians 6:10-20, you will notice the<br>
emphasis on the active part we must play on behalf of our own<br>
spiritual defense: &quot;be strong&quot; (verse 10); &quot;put on&quot; and &quot;stand<br>
firm&quot; (verse 11); &quot;take up,&quot; &quot;be able,&quot; &quot;resist,&quot; and &quot;stand<br>
firm&quot; (verse 13); &quot;stand firm&quot; (verse 14); &quot;taking up&quot; (verse<br>
16); &quot;take&quot; (verse 17)' &quot;pray at all times&quot; and &quot;be on the alert&quot;<br>
(verse 18).<br>
<br>
Over the next several days, we will consider each of the six<br>
pieces of armor from Ephesians 6:13-17.<br>
<br>
Teach me my responsibility in spiritual warfare, Lord, that I may<br>
be strong in You and in the strength of Your might.<br>

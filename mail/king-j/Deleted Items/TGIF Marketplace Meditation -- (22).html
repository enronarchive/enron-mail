Possessions of the Kingdom<br>
<br>
But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward<br>
they will come out with great possessions.<br>
- (Genesis 15:14)<br>
<br>
<br>
Whenever God brings you through a time of great adversity, you<br>
can expect to come out of that experience with great possessions,<br>
if you have been faithful through the trial. This is a universal<br>
truth. Wisdom comes from obedience, not knowledge. When we have<br>
been tested and proven, the reality of our faith results in<br>
possessions from God that we would never receive if we had not<br>
gone through those trials. These are precious in His sight and<br>
should be valued greatly. Those who know you will be amazed at<br>
the wisdom that comes from your mouth. It is one of those<br>
mysteries of the gospel that only those who experience incredible<br>
testing and hardship can explain.<br>
<br>
God kept the people of Israel enslaved 400 years, but when the<br>
time came to free them from the bondage of slavery, they came out<br>
with great possessions. These physical possessions symbolize the<br>
spiritual possessions we receive when we come out of being<br>
enslaved to those things that have hindered us all our lives.<br>
These possessions are to be shared with others so that they also<br>
can know how they might become free.<br>
<br>
What has God freed you from that allows you to share your<br>
possessions with others? Share what God has done in your life<br>
with someone you work with today. It may be the possession they<br>
need most in their life.<br>

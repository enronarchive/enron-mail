Paneled Houses<br>
<br>
&quot;Is it a time for you yourselves to be living in your paneled<br>
houses, while this house remains a ruin?&quot;<br>
- (Haggai 1:4)<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a crisis of grand proportions in the spiritual house of<br>
God today. The moral fiber of our world has eroded. Greed,<br>
idolatry, and pleasure are the gods of our day. And it is no<br>
different in the Body of Christ.<br>
<br>
The prophet Haggai wrote about a people who had lost concern for<br>
the need to build God's house because they were so focused on<br>
their own worldly needs. It is a dangerous place to get with God.<br>
When our world begins to focus around increasing our pleasure,<br>
building bigger and better homes, and failing to make what is<br>
important to God important in our own lives, this should be a<br>
warning to us.<br>
<br>
Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying<br>
and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers<br>
and the benches of those selling doves. &quot;It is written,&quot; He said<br>
to them, &quot; 'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you<br>
are making it a 'den of robbers' &quot; (Matthew. 21:12-13).<br>
<br>
Jesus came into Jerusalem and found the businesspeople buying and<br>
selling in the temple. As far as they knew, this was an<br>
acceptable practice in their day. Their fathers did it, and now<br>
they were doing it. It was business as usual. Jesus got angry,<br>
turned over the tables, and said that His house was a house of<br>
prayer. He found the businesspeople of the day seeing His house<br>
as a place for profit, not prayer. They had stepped into a place<br>
of complacency that was not acceptable to the Lord. When we begin<br>
to blend in with the moral condition of an ungodly world, we<br>
begin losing God's perspective on life.<br>
<br>
It is easy to begin blending in with our culture and to accept<br>
what is being modeled by the ungodly. God called us to be salt in<br>
a world that needs much salt. &quot;You are the salt of the earth. But<br>
if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?<br>
It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and<br>
trampled by men&quot; (Mt. 5:13). Each of us must ask ourselves if we<br>
have lost our salt. Are we having an impact on our world? Or is<br>
our world having an impact on us? Ask God to give you a vision<br>
for how you can be salt to your world today.<br>

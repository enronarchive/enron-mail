THE WILL OF GOD<br>
<br>
If any man is willing to do His will, he shall know of the<br>
teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from Myself<br>
(John 7:17).<br>
<br>
Knowing the will of God is not just a twentieth-century problem.<br>
People were struggling at the time of Christ. Some people were<br>
saying of Him, &quot;He's a good man.&quot; Others were saying, &quot;He leads<br>
the multitude astray&quot; (see John 7:12). How could these people<br>
know whether He was leading them into truth?<br>
<br>
Seizing the opportunity, Jesus set forth standards of divine<br>
guidance. His first admonition was, &quot;My teaching is not Mine, but<br>
His who sent Me. If any man is willing to do His will, he shall<br>
know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak<br>
from Myself&quot; (John 7:16, 17). The essential prerequisite to know<br>
the will of God, according to Jesus, is a willingness to do it.<br>
<br>
What is the will of God? God's will for those who believe in Him<br>
is to be alive in Christ for the purpose of establishing His<br>
kingdom by overcoming the evil one and becoming fully the people<br>
He has called us to be. Notice the opening words of the Lord's<br>
Prayer: &quot;Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy<br>
kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven&quot;<br>
(Matthew 6:9, 10). When praying this prayer, we are asking for<br>
God's will to be accomplished on earth as it presently is in<br>
heaven. Apparently God's will is being perfectly executed in<br>
heaven but not on earth.<br>
<br>
Are you totally committed to do God's will without knowing for<br>
sure what it is? Do you hold any reservations about turning your<br>
will over to God? Do you really believe that God's will for you<br>
is good, acceptable and perfect (Romans 12:2)? If God is God and<br>
you call Him Lord, doesn't He have the right to exercise His will<br>
in your life?<br>
<br>
Father, may Your will be accomplished in my thoughts, words and<br>
deeds today as it is being accomplished in heaven.<br>

OUR TRANSFER<br>
<br>
He delivered us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us<br>
to the kingdom of His beloved Son (Colossians 1:13).<br>
<br>
Perhaps you have heard the illustration of the two dogs. Some<br>
people say that we have two natures within us vying for control<br>
of our lives. They claim that our old sin nature, which we<br>
inherited from disobedient Adam, is like a big black dog. Our new<br>
nature, which we inherited through Christ's redemptive work, is<br>
like a big white dog. These two dogs are bitter enemies, intent<br>
on destroying each other. Whenever you involve yourself in<br>
worldly thoughts or behavior, you are feeding the black dog.<br>
Whenever you focus your mind and activities on spiritual things,<br>
you are feeding the white dog. The dog you feed the most will<br>
eventually grow stronger and overpower the other.<br>
<br>
This dramatic illustration may motivate Christians toward saintly<br>
behavior, but is it accurate based on who we really are in<br>
Christ? Since God &quot;delivered us from the domain of darkness and<br>
transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son&quot; (Colossians<br>
1:13), can we still be in both kingdoms? When God declares that<br>
we are &quot;not in the flesh but in the Spirit&quot; (Romans 8:9), can we<br>
be in the flesh and in the Spirit simultaneously? When God says<br>
that &quot;you were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the<br>
Lord&quot; (Ephesians 5:8), can you possibly be both light and<br>
darkness? When God states that &quot;if any man is in Christ, he is a<br>
new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have<br>
come&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:17), can we be partly new creature and<br>
partly old creature?<br>
<br>
But be careful. Can a Christian sin? Of course! &quot;If we say that<br>
we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not<br>
in us&quot; (1 John 1:8). But having sin and being sin are two<br>
completely different issues. When we choose to walk by the flesh<br>
we will sin, but, as 1 John 2:1 reminds us, we don't have to: &quot;My<br>
little children, I am writing these things to you that you may<br>
not sin.&quot;<br>
<br>
We will spend the next few days exploring the scriptural bases<br>
for this truth.<br>
<br>
How liberating to know today, Lord, that I am in the light, that<br>
I am a new creature, and that my new nature is firmly anchored in<br>
Your work of reconciliation.<br>

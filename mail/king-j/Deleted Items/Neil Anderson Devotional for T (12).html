MODELING GROWTH<br>
<br>
Prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who<br>
delude themselves (James 1:22).<br>
<br>
I am learning about pastors and missionaries across the country<br>
who are preaching against the very sins they are committing<br>
themselves. Nationally known Christian personalities who<br>
vehemently condemn immorality have themselves been found to be<br>
hiding an immoral lifestyle. Those of us who are called to preach<br>
or teach God's Word must put it on first. We must get on our<br>
knees before God as we prepare the message and say, &quot;God, is this<br>
Scripture true in my life?&quot; If not, we had better be honest<br>
enough to say to those who hear us, &quot;I wish I were a better<br>
example of this passage than I am, but I'm still growing in this<br>
area.&quot; To proclaim the Word of God as if it were true in your<br>
life when it's not is a lie.<br>
<br>
Those of us who receive the Word are also vulnerable to<br>
self-deception if we fail to put it into practice. We hear a<br>
sermon or a lesson and say, &quot;Wow! What a great truth!! and hurry<br>
off to share it with someone else without processing it ourselves<br>
and applying it to our own lives. James said that hearers of the<br>
Word who are not also doers of the Word deceive themselves.<br>
<br>
Why are we afraid to admit it when our lives don't completely<br>
match up to Scripture? I believe it's because many of us have a<br>
perfection complex. We think we have to model perfection and not<br>
admit to something less. But we can't model perfection, because<br>
we're not perfect; we can only model growth. The people around us<br>
need to know that we are real people in the process of maturing.<br>
They need to see how we handle failure as well as how we handle<br>
success. When we model this kind of honesty in the Christian<br>
community, we greatly reduce the possibility of the deceiver<br>
gaining a foothold.<br>
<br>
Lord, forgive me for the times I have placed the quest for<br>
earthly perfection ahead of growth in You and Your Word. Help me<br>
model growth in my life today.<br>

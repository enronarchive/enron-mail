SAFETY, SECURITY AND BELONGING<br>
<br>
My God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in<br>
glory in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:19).<br>
<br>
Not only was Adam given a significant, authoritative role at<br>
creation, he also enjoyed a sense of safety and security. All his<br>
needs were provided for (Genesis 1:29). Adam was completely cared<br>
for in the garden. He had plenty to eat and there was plenty for<br>
the animals. He could eat of the tree of life and live forever in<br>
God's presence. He lacked nothing.<br>
<br>
When Adam sinned, he lost that sense of safety and security.<br>
Before, he was naked and unashamed. After, he wanted to hide from<br>
God and cover up. The first emotion expressed by fallen humanity<br>
was fear.<br>
<br>
Safety and security is another facet of our inheritance in<br>
Christ. We have the riches of His kingdom at our disposal and His<br>
promise to supply all our needs.<br>
<br>
Adam and Eve also experienced a sense of belonging in that<br>
perfect garden. Adam apparently enjoyed intimate, one-on-one<br>
communion with God before Eve was created. Then God said it was<br>
not good for man to be alone (Genesis 2:18). So He gave Eve to<br>
Adam--and Adam to Eve--to enrich his experience of belonging.<br>
<br>
Before the Fall, Adam and Eve had a sense of belonging. But after<br>
the Fall they felt rejected, experiencing a need to belong. It is<br>
one of our greatest needs today. Notice that what were attributes<br>
before the Fall became needs after the Fall.<br>
<br>
I believe that a true sense of belonging today comes not only<br>
from knowing that we belong to God, but also from belonging to<br>
each other. When God created Eve He established human community.<br>
It's not good for us to be alone. Aloneness can lead to<br>
loneliness. God's preventative for loneliness is<br>
intimacy--meaningful, open, sharing relationships with one<br>
another. In Christ we have the capacity for the fulfilling sense<br>
of belonging which comes from intimate fellowship with God and<br>
with other believers.<br>
<br>
Lord, thank You that all my needs for safety, security and<br>
belonging are fully met in You.<br>

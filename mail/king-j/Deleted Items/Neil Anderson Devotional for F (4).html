SPRING-LOADED TOWARD THE SPIRIT<br>
<br>
Walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the<br>
flesh (Galatians 5:16).<br>
<br>
When we first became Christians, we were like one-third<br>
horsepower lawn mower engines. We could accomplish something, but<br>
not very much because we weren't very mature. Our ambition as<br>
Christians is to become engines that can power earth-moving<br>
machinery--real powerhouses for the Lord. But neither a lawn<br>
mower nor a bulldozer can accomplish anything without gas. And<br>
neither can we accomplish anything apart from Christ (John 15:5).<br>
No matter how mature you are, you can never be productive unless<br>
you are walking in the Spirit.<br>
<br>
When it comes to the choice between walking according to the<br>
flesh and walking according to the Spirit, our will is like a<br>
toggle switch. The new Christian's will seems to be spring-loaded<br>
toward fleshly behavior. He is still the unwitting victim of a<br>
thoroughly trained flesh which only knows how to operate<br>
independently of God. The mature Christian's will is<br>
spring-loaded toward the Spirit. He makes occasional poor<br>
choices, but he is learning to crucify the flesh and walk in the<br>
Spirit on a daily basis.<br>
<br>
If you re hoping for a magic formula or a list of foolproof steps<br>
for walking in the Spirit, you will be disappointed. The moment<br>
you reduce the Spirit-filled walk to a formula or an intellectual<br>
exercise, you probably won't be Spirit-filled anymore.<br>
<br>
The Holy Spirit is a &quot;He,&quot; not an &quot;it.&quot; Our walk with God is a<br>
personal experience, not a mechanical or legalistic formula. We<br>
see the immorality of fleshly indulgence everywhere, but simply<br>
preaching against it and telling people to shape up is not God's<br>
answer. The law is powerless to give life (Galatians 3:21).<br>
Reintroducing the law to believers won't work. But if we learn to<br>
walk by the Spirit, we won't carry out the desires of the flesh.<br>
Let's encourage others to do the same.<br>
<br>
Lord, I desire to be patient with others in their walk of faith<br>
as You are patient with me. Help me have a gracious response and<br>
a gentle answer to others today.<br>

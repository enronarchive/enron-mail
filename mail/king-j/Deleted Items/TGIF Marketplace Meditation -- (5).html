Horizontal Versus Vertical<br>
<br>
Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the<br>
Egyptian and hid him in the sand.<br>
- (Exodus 2:12)<br>
<br>
<br>
Moses saw the pain of his people. He saw the bondage and the<br>
injustice. His heart was enraged, and he decided he would do<br>
something. He would take matters into his own hands. The result<br>
was murder. The motive was right, but the action was wrong. He<br>
went horizontal instead of vertical with God. The action was<br>
wrong. Moses fled to the desert, where God prepared the man who<br>
would ultimately be the deliverer of a nation. But it took 40<br>
years of preparation before God determined Moses was ready. He<br>
was a professional businessman-a sheepherder. It was during the<br>
mundane activity of work that God called on him to be a<br>
deliverer.<br>
<br>
Moses was like a lot of enthusiastic Christian businesspeople who<br>
seek to solve a spiritual problem with a fleshly answer. The<br>
greatest danger to the Christian businessperson is his greatest<br>
strength-his business acumen and expertise to get things done.<br>
This self-reliance can become our greatest weakness when it comes<br>
to moving in the spiritual realm. We're taught to be problem<br>
solvers. But, like Moses, if our enthusiasm and passion are not<br>
harnessed by the power of the Holy Spirit, we will fail<br>
miserably. Peter had to learn this lesson too. His enthusiasm got<br>
him into a lot of trouble. But God was patient, just as He is<br>
patient with each of us. Sometimes He must put us in the desert<br>
for a time in order to season us so that Christ is allowed to<br>
reign supreme in the process.<br>
<br>
Before you act, pray and seek the mind of Christ until you know<br>
it is God behind the action. Check it out with others. You may<br>
save yourself a trip to the desert.<br>

HOW FAITH AFFECTS OUR LIVES<br>
<br>
For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of<br>
yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that<br>
no one should boast (Ephesians 2:8, 9).<br>
<br>
After Jesus claimed to be sent by God, some were seeking to seize<br>
Him, having come to the conclusion that He was not a good man.<br>
But others did believe in Him, &quot;and they were saying, 'When the<br>
Christ shall come, He will not perform more signs than those<br>
which this man has, will He?'&quot; (John 7:31). All the evidence was<br>
there. Some chose to believe; others chose not to. People do the<br>
same today. Faith is a choice. We choose to believe or not<br>
believe.<br>
<br>
Faith is the operating principle of life. It is the means by<br>
which we relate to God and live our lives in freedom. Notice the<br>
variety of ways stated in Scripture by which faith affects our<br>
lives.<br>
<br>
First, we are saved by faith (Ephesians 2:8, 9).<br>
<br>
Second, we &quot;walk by faith, not by sight&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:7).<br>
<br>
Third, being found faithful is a prerequisite for ministry: &quot;I<br>
thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He<br>
considered me faithful, putting me into service&quot; (1 Timothy<br>
1:12). Paul then adds, &quot;And the things which you have heard from<br>
me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful<br>
men, who will be able to teach others also&quot; (2 Timothy 2:2). This<br>
is more than being reliable, since a person could be counted on<br>
to follow through on an assignment and not be a believer. The<br>
added ingredient in faithful people is that they know the truth<br>
and can be counted on to be reliable.<br>
<br>
Fourth, the quality of any relationship is determined by faith or<br>
trust: &quot;Many a man proclaims his own loyalty, but who can find a<br>
trustworthy man?&quot; (Proverbs 20:6). The words faith, trust and<br>
believe are all the same word (pistis) in the original language.<br>
The man who has faith believes in something. The one who believes<br>
also trusts, or he doesn't truly believe. There is no concept<br>
that looms larger in life than faith because what we believe<br>
determines how we live.<br>
<br>
Lord, I affirm that I cannot please You without faith. I choose<br>
today to believe in You and trust in Your name.<br>

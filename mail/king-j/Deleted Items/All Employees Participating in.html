Summary Annual Report    <br>
<br>
The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). <br>
<br>
NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.<br>
<br>
<br>

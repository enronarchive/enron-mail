THE EFFECTS OF THE FALL<br>
<br>
Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,<br>
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because<br>
all sinned (Romans 5:12).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the idyllic setting in the Garden of Eden was<br>
shattered. Genesis 3 tells the sad story of Adam and Eve's lost<br>
relationship with God through sin. The effects of man's fall were<br>
dramatic, immediate and far-reaching, infecting every subsequent<br>
member of the human race.<br>
<br>
What happened to Adam and Eve spiritually because of the Fall?<br>
They died. Their union with God was severed and they were<br>
separated from God. God had specifically said: &quot;You must not eat<br>
from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat<br>
of it you will surely die&quot; (Genesis 2:17 NIV). They ate and they<br>
died.<br>
<br>
Did they die physically? No. The process of physical death was<br>
set in motion, but they were alive physically for several hundred<br>
more years. They died spiritually; their souls were separated<br>
from God. They were banished from God's presence. They were cast<br>
out of the Garden of Eden and guarding the entrance were cherubim<br>
waving a flaming sword (Genesis 3:23, 24).<br>
<br>
After Adam, everyone who comes into the world is born physically<br>
alive but spiritually dead, separated from God. Paul wrote, &quot;As<br>
for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which<br>
you used to live&quot; (Ephesians 2:1 NIV).<br>
<br>
How did Jesus remedy this problem? In two dramatic, life-changing<br>
ways. First, He died on the cross to cure the disease that caused<br>
us to die: sin. Romans 6:23 begins, &quot;The wages of sin is death.&quot;<br>
Then He rose from the dead to give us spiritual life. The verse<br>
continues, &quot;But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ<br>
Jesus our Lord.&quot; Jesus Himself said, &quot;I came that they might have<br>
life&quot; (John 10:10).<br>
<br>
The bad news is that , as a child of Adam, you inherited<br>
spiritual death. But the eternally good news is that, as a child<br>
of God through faith in Christ, you will live forever because of<br>
the life He has provided for you.<br>
<br>
Thank You, heavenly Father, for sending Jesus to die on the cross<br>
for my sins and then raising Him from the dead so I may have<br>
life.<br>

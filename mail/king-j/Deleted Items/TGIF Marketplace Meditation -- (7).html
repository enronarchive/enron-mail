Seeing the Works of God<br>
<br>
Others went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the<br>
mighty waters. They saw the works of the Lord....<br>
- (Psalms 107:23-24)<br>
<br>
<br>
When you were a child, perhaps you may have gone to the ocean for<br>
a vacation. I recall wading out until the waves began crashing on<br>
my knees. As long as I could stand firm, the waves were of no<br>
concern to me. However, as I moved farther and farther into the<br>
ocean, I had less control over my ability to stand. Sometimes the<br>
current was so strong it moved me down the beach, and I even lost<br>
my bearings at times. But I have never gone so far into the ocean<br>
that I was not able to control the situation.<br>
<br>
Sometimes God takes us into such deep waters that we lose control<br>
of the situation, and we have no choice but to fully trust in His<br>
care for us. This is doing business in great waters. It is in<br>
these great waters that we see the works of God.<br>
<br>
The Scriptures tell us that the disciples testified of what they<br>
saw and heard. It was the power behind the gospel, not the words<br>
themselves, that changed the world. The power wasn't seen until<br>
circumstances got to the point that there were no alternatives<br>
but God. Sometimes God has to take us into the deep water in<br>
order to give us the privilege to see His works.<br>
<br>
Sometimes God takes us into the deep waters of life for an<br>
extended time. Joseph was taken into deep waters of adversity for<br>
17 years. Rejection by his brothers, enslavement to Pharaoh, and<br>
imprisonment were the deep waters for Joseph. During those deep<br>
waters, he experienced dreams, a special anointing of his gifts<br>
to administrate, and great wisdom beyond his years. The deep<br>
water was preparation for a task that was so great he never could<br>
have imagined it. He was to see God's works more clearly than<br>
anyone in his generation. God had too much at stake for a<br>
30-year-old to mess it up. So, God took Joseph through the deep<br>
waters of preparation to ensure that he would survive what he was<br>
about to face. Pride normally engulfs such young servants who<br>
have such access to power at such a young age.<br>
<br>
If God chooses to take us into deep waters, it is for a reason.<br>
The greater the calling, the deeper the water. Trust in His<br>
knowledge that your deep waters are preparation to see the works<br>
of God in your life.<br>

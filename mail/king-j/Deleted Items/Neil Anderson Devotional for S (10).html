DEAD TO SIN<br>
<br>
Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God<br>
in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal<br>
body that you should obey its lusts (Romans 6:11, 12).<br>
<br>
Sin is the condition into which all descendants of fallen Adam<br>
are born (Romans 5:12). Sin is living our lives independently of<br>
God. It's the result of being deceived by Satan to believe that<br>
meaning and purpose in life may be achieved apart from a personal<br>
relationship with, and obedience to, the Creator of life<br>
(Deuteronomy 30:19, 20; 1 John 5:12). In the non-Christian, sin<br>
permeates the old nature, dominates the old self, and perpetuates<br>
the deeds of the flesh. Satan is at the heart of all sin (1 John<br>
3:8). He deceives people into believing a lie and counsels them<br>
to rebel against God.<br>
<br>
When you received Christ you died to sin and its power to<br>
dominate you was broken. Satan and sin have not died; they are<br>
still strong and appealing. But you no longer have to sin because<br>
you are dead to sin and alive to God in Christ (Romans 6:11). You<br>
are not dead to sin because you consider it so; you consider it<br>
so because it is so. In Christ you have already died to sin.<br>
<br>
Paul goes on to say that we are not to use our bodies as<br>
instruments of unrighteousness (verse 13). If we do, we allow sin<br>
to rule in our mortal bodies. For example, it is virtually<br>
impossible for someone to commit a sexual sin and not use his<br>
body as an instrument of unrighteousness, allowing sin to rule.<br>
Ask the Lord to reveal to your mind how you have wrongly used<br>
your body, especially sexually. Renounce that wrong use and then<br>
submit your body to God as a living sacrifice. It is your<br>
responsibility not to let &quot;sin reign in your mortal body that you<br>
should obey its lusts&quot; (Romans 6:12).<br>
<br>
Loving Lord, I know that sin's power over me has been broken.<br>
Help me live today in the light of that truth by renouncing sin<br>
and submitting my body to You.<br>

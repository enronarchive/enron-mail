Standing in the Gap<br>
<br>
I looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and<br>
stand before Me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not<br>
have to destroy it, but I found none.<br>
- (Ezekiel 22:30)<br>
<br>
<br>
The people of Israel fell into sin when they worshiped the golden<br>
calf. It would not be the last time God's people would fall into<br>
idol worship. They had forgotten the great things God had done<br>
for them. This angered God so much that He was going to destroy<br>
the whole nation. Only one thing changed God's mind in the<br>
matter-Moses. Psalm 106:23 says, &quot;...had not Moses, His chosen<br>
one, stood in the breach before Him to keep His wrath from<br>
destroying them.&quot; Moses was a man willing to stand in the gap,<br>
sacrificially, for those who were not deserving of such<br>
sacrifice. This sacrificial love by Moses is called for among His<br>
people today.<br>
<br>
The prophet Ezekiel described another situation in which God's<br>
people fell into sin. God was ready to destroy the nation when He<br>
spoke to Ezekiel, asking him if there is a man willing to stand<br>
in the gap so that God would not have to destroy His people.<br>
<br>
Judah was a man who stood in the gap on behalf of his younger<br>
brother Benjamin. Joseph held his brother Simeon hostage as<br>
insurance that the other brothers would bring Benjamin to Egypt.<br>
Judah had a long history of a me-focused life, but in this<br>
instance he came forward to stand in the gap for his younger<br>
brother. He responded to the anguish of his father, Jacob, by<br>
personally guaranteeing the safe return of both Simeon and<br>
Benjamin. Judah's sacrifice was rewarded (see Gen. 42-43).<br>
<br>
Just as Christ did, we are to be those who will stand in the gap<br>
on behalf of others who are not aware of their own vulnerable<br>
condition. It is a proactive sacrificial position. Who is God<br>
calling you to stand in the gap for? Perhaps it is a mate;<br>
perhaps it is a business associate who has not come to know the<br>
Savior; perhaps it is a wayward child. Are you willing to become<br>
the sacrificial offering to God to change His plans of judgment<br>
because of your willingness to stand in their place? This is a<br>
hard teaching. This is what Jesus did for each of us. When we<br>
stand in the place of another, God moves because of our<br>
willingness to stand on their behalf. If we don't, His plans will<br>
go forward because He is a righteous and holy God who will honor<br>
His own word, even if it means destruction. Are you willing to<br>
stand in the breach of the wall for someone today? Perhaps you<br>
are the only person who will stand on someone's behalf.<br>

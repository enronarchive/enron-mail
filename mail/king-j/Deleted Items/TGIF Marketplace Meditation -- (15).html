Fruitful Suffering<br>
<br>
...&quot;It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my<br>
suffering.&quot;<br>
- (Genesis 41:52)<br>
<br>
<br>
Joseph named his second son Ephraim. Ephraim was given to him<br>
after he had been delivered from his suffering of 13 years.<br>
Joseph said that he named him this because God had made him<br>
fruitful in the land of his suffering. Ephraim means &quot;twice<br>
fruitful.&quot;<br>
<br>
Joseph was fruitful in two instances. He was fruitful during his<br>
time of adversity and in his prosperity. When God brings us into<br>
a time of suffering, it can be a fruitful time. It's rare for us<br>
to see the fruit during the suffering period. But know that the<br>
roots are going deep into the spiritual soil of our soul because<br>
of our pressing in to God during our time of suffering. This is<br>
producing a work in our character that cannot be seen until it<br>
finishes the process. Such was the case for Joseph.<br>
<br>
It was not until several years after such a time of suffering<br>
that I began to see the fruit of the trials that the Lord allowed<br>
me to experience. How grateful I am to understand some of the<br>
&quot;why&quot; that has led to a new life in Him that I would never have<br>
had without this period.<br>
<br>
Samson had great anointing but lacked character. We see many<br>
today who have great anointing yet lack character. But God is<br>
raising up Josephs who not only have great anointing for these<br>
days but also great character. Suffering produces character.<br>
<br>
If you find yourself in a time of suffering, now is the time to<br>
press into God. Let your roots grow deeper. Whenever there is a<br>
famine, tree roots are forced to drive deeper into the soil to<br>
find water. These times are designed to create such a deep-rooted<br>
faith that our natures will be changed forever.<br>

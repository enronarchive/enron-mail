THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS<br>
<br>
Having put on the breastplate of righteousness . . . (Ephesians<br>
6:14).<br>
<br>
The second piece of armor God has provided for us is the<br>
breastplate of righteousness. When you put on Christ at<br>
salvation, you are justified before our holy God. It's not your<br>
righteousness but Christ's (1 Corinthians 1:30; Philippians 3:8,<br>
9). So when Satan aims an arrow at you by saying, &quot;You're not<br>
good enough to be a Christian,&quot; you can respond with Paul, &quot;Who<br>
will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one who<br>
justifies&quot; (Romans 8:33). Your righteousness in Christ is your<br>
protection against Satan's accusations.<br>
<br>
Even though we rejoice in our position of righteousness in<br>
Christ, we are well aware of our deeds of unrighteousness when we<br>
think, say, or do something apart from God. Standing firm in our<br>
righteousness requires us to live in continuous agreement with<br>
God according to 1 John 1:9: &quot;If we confess our sins, He is<br>
faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us<br>
from all unrighteousness.&quot; Confession is different from saying<br>
&quot;I'm sorry&quot; or asking forgiveness. To confess (homologeo) means<br>
to acknowledge or to agree. You confess your sin when you say<br>
what God says about it: &quot;I entertained a lustful thought and<br>
that's a sin&quot;; &quot;I treated my spouse unkindly this morning and<br>
that was wrong&quot;; &quot;Pride motivated me to seek that board position<br>
and pride doesn't belong in my life.&quot;<br>
<br>
Satan will make confession as difficult for you as he can. He<br>
will try to convince you that it's too late for confession, that<br>
God has already erased your name out of the book of life. That's<br>
another one of his lies. You're in Christ; you're already<br>
forgiven. You are the righteousness of God in Christ (2<br>
Corinthians 5:21), and He will never leave you. Your confession<br>
of sin clears the way for the fruitful expression of<br>
righteousness in your daily life. We should be like Paul, who<br>
said, &quot;I also do my best to maintain always a blameless<br>
conscience both before God and before men&quot; (Acts 24:16).<br>
<br>
Lord, I put on the breastplate of righteousness today and seek to<br>
maintain a blameless conscience before You and the people around<br>
me.<br>

<br>
A New Breed of Businesspeople<br>
<br>
Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to<br>
Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of<br>
the people....<br>
- (Haggai 2:2)<br>
<br>
<br>
Zerubbabel was the governor of Judah 60 years after the great<br>
temple built by Solomon had been destroyed. The temple lay in<br>
ruins, and the Lord spoke to the prophet Haggai, &quot;Is it a time<br>
for you yourselves to be living in your paneled houses, while<br>
this house remains a ruin?&quot; (Hag. 1:4) God was calling for a<br>
remnant of His people to come out of their comfort zones and<br>
restore the glory of God's house.<br>
<br>
God is doing this same thing today among Christian businesspeople<br>
throughout the world. He is raising up a remnant of<br>
businesspeople who are being handpicked to use their resources,<br>
skills, and experience to affect nations that have not heard the<br>
message of Jesus Christ. The only way they can hear is by<br>
commerce being brought into their nation through Christian<br>
businesspeople, because these are closed regions to normal<br>
missionary efforts.<br>
<br>
&quot;But now be strong, O Zerubbabel,&quot; declares the Lord. &quot;Be strong,<br>
O Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you<br>
people of the land,&quot; declares the Lord, &quot;and work. For I am with<br>
you,&quot; declares the Lord Almighty. &quot;This is what I covenanted with<br>
you when you came out of Egypt. And My Spirit remains among you.<br>
Do not fear&quot; (Haggai 2:4-5).<br>
<br>
The remnant of businesspeople God is calling today understand<br>
that they have to come out of Egypt from their past business<br>
life. Egypt signifies the way of the world. It represents sweat<br>
and toil. It is the flesh. This new way is exemplified by a<br>
pioneer spirit. God knows we need to have courage in order to<br>
move in this realm. Also, God assures us that His Spirit is with<br>
anyone who seeks to live in the realm of supernatural faith.<br>
<br>
Are you one of these remnants He has handpicked in these days?<br>
Has He called you out of Egypt in order to do extraordinary<br>
things in your life for His Kingdom? Ask God to show you how He<br>
wants to use you in the marketplace this year. Then act and &quot;be<br>
strong, all you people of the land.&quot;<br>

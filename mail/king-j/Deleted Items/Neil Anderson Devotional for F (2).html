THE SIGNIFICANT DOMINION<br>
<br>
Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let<br>
them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky<br>
and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every<br>
creeping thing that creeps on the earth (Genesis 1:26).<br>
<br>
In the original creation, Adam didn't search for significance; he<br>
was significant. He was given rule over all His creatures. Was<br>
Satan on the scene at creation? Yes. Was he the god of this world<br>
at that time? Not at all. Who had the dominion in the garden?<br>
Under the authority of God, Adam did, that is until Satan usurped<br>
his dominion when Adam and Eve fell. That's when Satan became the<br>
god of this world.<br>
<br>
Do you realize that the significant dominion Adam exercised<br>
before the Fall has been restored to you as a Christian? That's<br>
part of your inheritance in Christ. Satan has no authority over<br>
you, even though he will try to deceive you into believing that<br>
he has. Because of your position in Christ, you have authority<br>
over him. You are seated with Christ in the heavenlies (Ephesians<br>
2:6).<br>
<br>
First John 3:8 says, &quot;The Son of God appeared for this purpose,<br>
that He might destroy the works of the devil.&quot; The whole plan of<br>
God is to restore fallen humanity and establish the kingdom of<br>
God where Satan now reigns. This work of God is not just for our<br>
personal victory but for all of creation. &quot;For the anxious<br>
longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the<br>
sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not of<br>
its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that<br>
the creation itself will also be set free from its slavery to<br>
corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God&quot;<br>
(Romans 8:19-21).<br>
<br>
Thank You, Lord, that I am part of Your redemptive plan. Show me<br>
my responsibility so I may live a life of purpose.<br>

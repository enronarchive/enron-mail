THE DEFINITION OF DISCIPLESHIP<br>
<br>
Encourage one another, and build up one another, just as you also<br>
are doing (1 Thessalonians 5:11).<br>
<br>
Jesus' primary call to His disciples is seen in His words &quot;Come<br>
to Me&quot; (Matthew 11:28) and &quot;Follow Me&quot; (Matthew 4:19). Mark<br>
records: &quot;He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him, and<br>
that He might send them out to preach, and to have authority to<br>
cast out the demons&quot; (Mark 3:14, 15). Notice that Jesus'<br>
relationship with His disciples preceded His assignment to them.<br>
Discipleship is the intensely personal activity of two or more<br>
persons helping each other experience a growing relationship with<br>
God. Discipleship is being before doing, maturity before<br>
ministry, character before career.<br>
<br>
Every Christian, including you, is both a disciple and a<br>
discipler in the context of his Christian relationships. You have<br>
the awesome privilege and responsibility both to be a teacher and<br>
a learner of what it means to be in Christ, walk in the spirit<br>
and live by faith. You may have a role in your family, church or<br>
Christian community which gives you specific responsibility for<br>
discipling others, such as husband/father, pastor, Sunday school<br>
teacher, discipleship group leader, etc. But even as an appointed<br>
discipler, you are never not a disciple who is learning and<br>
growing in Christ through your relationships. Conversely, you may<br>
not have an &quot;official&quot; responsibility to disciple anyone, but you<br>
are never not a discipler. You have the opportunity to help your<br>
children, your friend, and other believers grow in Christ through<br>
your caring and committed relationship with them.<br>
<br>
Similarly, every Christian is both a counselor and counselee in<br>
the context of his Christian relationships. A good counselor<br>
should be a good discipler, and a good discipler should be a good<br>
counselor. Biblically, they are the same role. Your level of<br>
maturity may dictate that you do a lot of Christian counseling.<br>
But there will still be times when you need to seek or receive<br>
the counsel of other Christians. There will never be a day when<br>
we don't need each other.<br>
<br>
Father, help me remember that I will never be so mature that I<br>
need not receive godly counsel from my brothers and sisters in<br>
Christ.<br>

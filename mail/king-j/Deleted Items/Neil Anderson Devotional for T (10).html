THE BONDAGE BREAKER<br>
<br>
If therefore the Son shall make you free, you shall be free<br>
indeed (John 8:36).<br>
<br>
The contrast between bondage and freedom in a believer's life is<br>
beautifully illustrated in the following letter from a successful<br>
professional man.<br>
<br>
    Dear Neil:<br>
<br>
    My emotional troubles were probably rooted in my childhood<br>
    experiences with horror movies, Ouija boards, etc. I clearly<br>
    remember fearing a visit from devilish forces after I saw the<br>
    movie titled The Blood of Dracula.<br>
<br>
    My father had a pretty hot temper and was given to emotional<br>
    outbursts. My survival response was to sulk and blame myself<br>
    for upsetting him. Bottling my emotions inside became a way<br>
    of life. As I grew into adulthood, I continued to blame<br>
    myself for any and all personal shortcomings and misfortunes.<br>
<br>
    Then I accepted Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. I grew<br>
    spiritually over the next several years, but I never enjoyed<br>
    complete peace. There was always a lingering doubt about my<br>
    relationship with God whom I saw as distant and stern. I had<br>
    difficulty praying, reading the Bible and paying attention to<br>
    the pastor's sermons. I seriously questioned the purpose of<br>
    life. I experienced horrible nightmares which woke me up<br>
    screaming.<br>
<br>
    It was during my time of prayer with you that I finally found<br>
    freedom in Christ. Now when I read God's Word, I understand<br>
    it like never before. I have developed a more positive<br>
    attitude, and my entire relationship with my Lord has<br>
    completely changed. Since our meeting, I haven't had one<br>
    nightmare.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that every spiritual problem is the result of<br>
direct demonic activity. But you may be in bondage because you<br>
have overlooked or denied the reality of demonic powers at work<br>
in the world. Your inheritance in Christ is the basis for your<br>
complete freedom promised in Scripture.<br>
<br>
Help me not to be a spiritual ostrich today, but to be alert to<br>
my enemy's tactics and to Your truth.<br>
<br>

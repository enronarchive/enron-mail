Sweating Outcomes<br>
<br>
In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to<br>
eat-for He grants sleep to those He loves.<br>
- (Psalms 127:2)<br>
<br>
<br>
Coming into the Promised Land in business will change the way you<br>
and I view our work. No longer will we see getting up early and<br>
staying up late as God's way. Living in the Promised Land in<br>
business means we know that God is the source of our provision<br>
and that our work is an act of worship to Him. Provision is a<br>
by-product, not an end in itself. Work is no longer something<br>
that must be sweated and toiled upon to make ends meet. &quot;Could<br>
this really be true?&quot; you might be saying. God has made it clear<br>
that obedience is the assurance of provision. Whenever we go<br>
beyond the normal workday due to fear of non-provision, we are<br>
operating in unbelief. We are saying that it is up to us to make<br>
things happen. Sure, there are times when we work longer hours<br>
due to a deadline, but we must be sure the motive is not out of<br>
fear of loss or fear of non-provision. If we are obedient to what<br>
God has called us to, He will provide our every need. This can be<br>
a hard lesson for goal-oriented businesspeople.<br>
<br>
I recall coming into this understanding. I had been a workaholic.<br>
Long hours were common. Then God shook up my world and I was<br>
challenged by a friend to examine my motives for working long<br>
hours. I realized the source of those long hours was fear. Once I<br>
came into this understanding, I refused to work long hours even<br>
though the natural man would tell me I'd never make things happen<br>
if I worked a normal work week. Again, this reasoning is based on<br>
a lack of faith. If we are obedient to what God has called each<br>
of us to, we will not lack. At times it may be less than what we<br>
might like; at other times it may be more than we deserve. These<br>
are God's ways.<br>
<br>
The Bible tells us to come out of Babylon. Babylon is a system of<br>
work and philosophy that is contrary to God's ways. Are you<br>
operating in any aspect of work from a Babylonian value system?<br>
Ask the Lord to reveal this to you. Begin to walk in the freedom<br>
He has given us in our work life.<br>

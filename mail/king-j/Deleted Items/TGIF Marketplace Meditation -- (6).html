Passing the Tests<br>
<br>
The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to<br>
one of your neighbors-to David.<br>
- (1 Samuel 28:17)<br>
<br>
<br>
When God anoints a person, a pattern of testing appears to take<br>
place at specific times in the leader's life. God often takes<br>
each leader through four major tests to determine if that person<br>
will achieve God's ultimate call on his or her life. The person's<br>
response to these tests is the deciding factor in whether they<br>
can advance to the next level of responsibility in God's Kingdom.<br>
<br>
Control-Control is one of the first tests. Saul spent most of his<br>
time as king trying to prevent others from getting what he had.<br>
Saul never got to the place with God in which he was a grateful<br>
recipient of God's goodness to him. Saul was a religious<br>
controller. This control led to disobedience and ultimately being<br>
rejected by God because Saul no longer was a vessel God could<br>
use.<br>
<br>
Bitterness-Every major character in the Bible was hurt by another<br>
person at one time or another. Jesus was hurt deeply when Judas,<br>
a trusted follower, betrayed Him. Despite knowing this was going<br>
to happen, Jesus responded by washing Judas' feet. Every anointed<br>
leader will have a Judas experience at one time or another. God<br>
watches us to see how we will respond to this test. Will we take<br>
up an offense? Will we retaliate? It is one of the most difficult<br>
tests to pass.<br>
<br>
Power-Power is the opposite of servanthood. Jesus had all<br>
authority in Heaven and earth, so satan tempted Jesus at the top<br>
of the mountain to use His power to remove Himself from a<br>
difficult circumstance. How will we use the power and influence<br>
God has entrusted to us? Do we seek to gain more power? There is<br>
a common phrase in the investment community, &quot;He who has the gold<br>
rules.&quot; Jesus modeled the opposite. He was the ultimate servant<br>
leader.<br>
<br>
Greed-This is a difficult one. Money has the ability to have<br>
great influence for either good or bad. When it is a focus in our<br>
life, it becomes a tool of destruction. When it is a by-product,<br>
it can become a great blessing. Many leaders started out<br>
well-only to be derailed once prosperity became a part of their<br>
life. There are thousands who can blossom spiritually in<br>
adversity; only a few can thrive spiritually under prosperity.<br>
<br>
As leaders, we must be aware when we are being tested. You can be<br>
confident that each one of these tests will be thrown your way if<br>
God calls you for His purposes. Will you pass these tests? Ask<br>
for God's grace today to walk through these tests victoriously.<br>

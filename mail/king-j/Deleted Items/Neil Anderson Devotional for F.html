<br>
DON'T BELIEVE IT<br>
<br>
Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be<br>
defiled by them (Leviticus 19:31).<br>
<br>
Where do mediums and spiritists get their &quot;amazing&quot; information<br>
and insights? Many of them are demonic channelers, but much of<br>
what is called &quot;spiritism&quot; and &quot;psychic phenomena&quot; is no more<br>
than clever illusion. hese so-called spiritists give what is<br>
referred to as &quot;cold readings.&quot; You go to them for advice or<br>
direction, and they ask you a few simple, leading questions.<br>
Based on the information you give, they make general observations<br>
which are probably true of most people in your situation. But<br>
you're so impressed with the accuracy of their &quot;revelations&quot; that<br>
you start tipping them off to all kinds of details which they can<br>
fabricate into their &quot;reading.&quot; This is not demonic; it's just<br>
mental and verbal sleight-of-hand.<br>
<br>
But the mediums and spiritists that God warned against in<br>
Leviticus and Deuteronomy were not con artists, but people who<br>
possessed and passed on knowledge which didn't come through<br>
natural channels of perception. These people have opened<br>
themselves up to the spirit world and have become channels of<br>
knowledge from Satan. The charlatan with his phony cold readings<br>
is only interested in bilking you of your money. But the false<br>
knowledge and direction which comes from Satan through a medium<br>
is intended to bilk you of your spiritual vitality and freedom.<br>
<br>
There's big money in psychic/con artist operations, and a lot of<br>
magicians are raking it in. Many people crave to know something<br>
extra about their lives and their future, and they will pay<br>
handsomely if they think you can give them the inside information<br>
they desire.<br>
<br>
When a psychic claims to have contacted the dead, don't believe<br>
it. When a psychologist claims to have regressed a client back to<br>
a former existence through hypnosis, don't believe it. When a New<br>
Age medium purports to channel a person from the past into the<br>
present, realize that it is nothing more than a familiar spirit<br>
or the fraudulent work of a con artist.<br>
<br>
Lord Jesus, You are the way, the truth and the life. I renounce<br>
any power or revelation from any other source than You.<br>

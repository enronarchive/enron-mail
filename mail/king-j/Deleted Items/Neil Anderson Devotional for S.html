THE EQUATION FOR WHOLENESS<br>
<br>
Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and<br>
many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and<br>
destruction (1 Timothy 6:9).<br>
<br>
In his book The Sensation of Being Somebody, Maurice Wagner<br>
expresses a false belief in simple equations we tend to accept.<br>
He says we mistakenly think that good appearance plus the<br>
admiration it brings equals a whole person. Or we feel that star<br>
performance plus accomplishments equals a whole person. Or we<br>
believe that a certain amount of status plus the recognition we<br>
accumulate equals a whole person. Not so. These equations are no<br>
more correct than two plus two equals six. Wagner says: &quot;Try as<br>
we might by our appearance, performance, or social status to find<br>
self-verification for a sense of being somebody, we always come<br>
short of satisfaction. Whatever pinnacle of self-identity we<br>
achieve soon crumbles under the pressure of hostile rejection or<br>
criticism, introspection or guilt, fear or anxiety. We cannot do<br>
anything to qualify for the by-product of being loved<br>
unconditionally and voluntarily&quot; (Maurice Wagner, The Sensation<br>
of Being Somebody, Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House,<br>
1975, p. 163).<br>
<br>
If these equations could work for anyone, they would have worked<br>
for King Solomon. He was the king of Israel during the greatest<br>
years in her history. If a meaningful life is the result of<br>
appearance, admiration, performance, accomplishments, status, or<br>
recognition, Solomon would have been the most together man who<br>
ever lived.<br>
<br>
But God also gave the king an extra dose of wisdom to interpret<br>
his achievements. What was his commentary on it all?<br>
&quot;Meaningless! Meaningless! . . . Utterly meaningless! Everything<br>
is meaningless&quot; (Ecclesiastes 1:2 NIV). Take the advice of the<br>
wise king: All the stuff and status you can acquire don't add up<br>
to personal wholeness. Millions of people climb those ladders to<br>
success, only to discover when they reach the top that they are<br>
leaning against the wrong wall! The only identity equation that<br>
works in God's kingdom is you plus Christ equals wholeness and<br>
meaning.<br>
<br>
Heavenly Father, I affirm that nothing in this world can make me<br>
more complete than I already am in Christ.<br>

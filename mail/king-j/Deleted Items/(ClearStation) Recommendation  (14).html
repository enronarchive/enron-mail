	 close short ATVI.     potentially makes a record price high here.   interesting nexus.  stock recorded a record price in early june.  june and july saw 2 attempts to take out this record price high, both turned back.  another attempt in august turned back at 38.     and here we are again.  does it get turned back?  dont want to be on the wrong side if it does.     kensey  	<br>

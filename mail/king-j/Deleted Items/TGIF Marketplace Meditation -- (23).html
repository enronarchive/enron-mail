Unprofitable Anger<br>
<br>
Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in<br>
the lap of fools.<br>
- (Ecclesiastes 7:9)<br>
<br>
<br>
Every day of our lives we are placed in situations that engage us<br>
with other people, whether it is in the office, our homes, or in<br>
public places. Do you recall the last time someone cut you off in<br>
traffic, or you were forced to wait in line because someone up<br>
front got held up? Perhaps your employer did something that was<br>
downright unfair. Anger can result from many circumstances.<br>
<br>
A friend once told me that anger is like warning lights on the<br>
front of your car dashboard. They signal that there is something<br>
going on under the hood, and we should take a look to examine the<br>
source of the problem. Anger can be traced to a few sources.<br>
First, when we lose control of a circumstance that we have placed<br>
certain expectations on and those expectations do not result in<br>
our desired outcome, we are tempted to get angry. The source of<br>
this type of anger is both fear and protection of personal<br>
rights. You see, when we believe we have a right to something, we<br>
have not given the Lord permission to allow an outcome different<br>
from what we want. If an outcome is different from our<br>
expectations, this may stimulate fear.<br>
<br>
For instance, if a vendor failed to deliver an important job on<br>
time due to something out of his control, you may respond out of<br>
anger. Please know that the source of your anger is the fear of<br>
what might happen to you or what this might say about your<br>
abilities to manage a project. You no longer are in control of<br>
the circumstance and this creates fear in you.<br>
<br>
The next time you get angry ask the Lord what is the source of<br>
that anger? Did the Lord allow that failure to let you see what<br>
is &quot;under your hood&quot;? God has not given us a spirit of fear, but<br>
of love, power, and a sound mind (see 2 Tim. 1:7). Give up your<br>
rights to expectations that God never gave you. You will find a<br>
new freedom in Christ you never knew you could have.<br>

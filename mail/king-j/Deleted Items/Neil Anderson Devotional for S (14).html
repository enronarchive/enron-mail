A RADICAL, INNER TRANSFORMATION<br>
<br>
By the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did<br>
not prove vain (1 Corinthians 15:10).<br>
<br>
If you believe that you are part light and part darkness, part<br>
saint and part sinner, you will live in a very mediocre manner<br>
with little to distinguish you from the non-Christian. You may<br>
confess your proneness to sin and strive to do better, but you<br>
will live a continually defeated life because you perceive<br>
yourself to be only a sinner saved by grace who is hanging on<br>
until the rapture. Satan knows he can do nothing about who you<br>
really are, but if he can get you to believe you are no different<br>
from the natural person, then you will behave no differently from<br>
the natural person.<br>
<br>
Why does this profile describe so many Christians? Because we are<br>
ignorant of our true identity in Christ. God's work of atonement<br>
in changing sinners to saints is His greatest accomplishment on<br>
earth. The inner change, justification, is effected at the moment<br>
of salvation. The outer change in the believer's daily walk,<br>
sanctification, continues throughout life. But the progressive<br>
work of sanctification is only fully effective when the radical,<br>
inner transformation of justification is realized and<br>
appropriated by faith.<br>
<br>
&quot;But didn't I read somewhere that Paul referred to himself as the<br>
chief of sinners?&quot; you may wonder. Yes, but he was referring to<br>
his nature before his conversion to Christ (1 Timothy 1:12-16).<br>
He made a similar statement of self-depreciation in 1 Corinthians<br>
15:9, but continued by saying: &quot;But by the grace of God I am what<br>
I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain&quot; (verse 10).<br>
Paul knew that who he was before Christ and who he became in<br>
Christ were two separate identities.<br>
<br>
If you claim to be just a sinner, what will you do? You will sin!<br>
You are professing that sin is at the core of your identity.<br>
That's not what the Bible teaches. Why don't we just believe God<br>
that Jesus is at the core of our being and then begin to live<br>
like it by His Spirit?<br>
<br>
Thank You, Father, that I am complete in Your Son Jesus and that<br>
my identity is rooted in Him and not in my sin.<br>

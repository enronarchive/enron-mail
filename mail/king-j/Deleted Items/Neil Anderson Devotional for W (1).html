RESOLVING A PAST CONFLICT<br>
<br>
Teach me your way, O LORD, and I will walk in your truth; give me<br>
an undivided heart (Psalm 86:11 NIV).<br>
<br>
You have no control over a primary emotion, developed in the<br>
past, when it is triggered. It doesn't do any good to feel guilty<br>
about something over which you have no control. But you can seek<br>
to resolve the past conflict and you can immediately evaluate the<br>
present circumstance to bring it into perspective. For example,<br>
suppose you meet a man named Bill. He looks like the Bill who<br>
used to beat you up as a child. Even though he's not the same<br>
person, your primary emotion initially jumps to a 3 on a scale of<br>
10. But you mentally tell yourself that this is not the same<br>
Bill, and you think yourself down to a 2.<br>
<br>
You have not only used this process yourself thousands of times,<br>
but you have also helped others do it. Someone flies off the<br>
handle, so you grab him and tell him to get hold of himself. You<br>
are helping that person gain control of himself by making him<br>
think. Notice how this works the next time you're watching a<br>
football game and tempers explode on the field. One player grabs<br>
an enraged teammate and says, &quot;Listen, Meathead, you're going to<br>
cost us a 15-yard penalty and perhaps the game if you don't<br>
simmer down.&quot; The player will see the conflict in perspective and<br>
will get himself under control by thinking clearly.<br>
<br>
Some Christians assert that the past isn't important. If you're<br>
talking about truth, then I would agree. The truth is<br>
truth--past, present and future. But if you are talking about<br>
what people are actually experiencing, I would have to disagree.<br>
Most of the people who argue that the past isn't important have<br>
major unresolved conflicts from the past which they are not<br>
allowing to surface. They are attempting to handle themselves by<br>
living in denial. Either that or they are extremely fortunate to<br>
have a conflict-free past. Those who have had major traumas and<br>
have learned to resolve them in Christ know how devastating the<br>
past can be to present reality.<br>
<br>
Lord, I choose not to live in denial. Give me the grace to look<br>
at my past and the courage to face the truth.<br>

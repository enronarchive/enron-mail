TERRA SYSTEMS (Pink Sheets: TSYI)<br>
Latest price: 30 cents<br>
<br>
<br>
Take a close look at TERRA SYSTEMS (Pink Sheets: TSYI) -<br>
latest price: 30 cents - which has just released the<br>
following news.<br>
<br>
The group behind TSYI is the same people who put together<br>
ETGP. When they got involved in ETGP, the stock was trading<br>
at a similar price (20 - 25 cents). It lifted to 50 - 60<br>
cents in a short period of time. ETGP did a 10 for 1<br>
reverse (not needed in TSYI) so that it traded $5.00 -<br>
$6.00 in July of 1995 on the Bulletin Board. The stock went<br>
to $66.00 in September of 1995 and split two for one. The<br>
whole transaction took less than a year.<br>

TERRA SYSTEMS, INC. ANNOUNCES POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF ITS<br>
TECHNOLOGY BY SCIENTIFIC CONSULTING GROUP<br>
<br>
PAYSON, Utah--Oct. 25, 2001--Terra Systems, Inc. (PINK<br>
SHEETS - TSYI) announced today that a Santa Fe, NM-based<br>
scientific consulting firm, the La Mancha Company, has<br>
completed an initial study (commissioned by TSYI) about the<br>
Company's patented Pneumatic Accelerator technology.<br>
<br>
The title of the report is ``Dry Bulk Materials Handling<br>
Technology With Emphasis On Coal.'' The report's<br>
conclusions are positive concerning TSYI technology's<br>
technical and economic feasibility. In part because TSYI is<br>
still a development-stage company, La Mancha's report cites<br>
certain caveats including that ``...these general<br>
conclusions must be adequately measured and documented in<br>
rigorous pilot-test environments such as those proposed by<br>
TSYI....''<br>
<br>
The Summary Statement of the La Mancha Report says: ``In<br>
conclusion, the process and its potential application to<br>
utilization in coal-fired power generation, the recovery of<br>
usable coal fines from long-accumulating waste sites, and<br>
its environmentally ''friendly`` attributes, constitute an<br>
intriguing and innovative approach to assisting in<br>
reconciling the current dichotomy of energy demand and<br>
environmental concern. The proposed Phase I Program (of<br>
Terra Systems) should be supported as a first step.''<br>
<br>
Commenting on this study, Clayton Timothy, Chairman of<br>
TSYI, said: ``We are very pleased with the positive<br>
conclusions about our technology that this report has<br>
reached. The La Mancha Company is a prestigious scientific<br>
consulting firm; and, in this case, two of the authors of<br>
the report hold Ph.D.s in relevant physical sciences and<br>
are also retirees from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br>
We recognize the challenges TSYI faces in achieving<br>
successful commercialization, including those mentioned in<br>
this report. But, we also feel this study provides<br>
substantial professional support for the faith we have in<br>
the scientific and economic efficacy of the Company's<br>
unique process for dry bulk materials handling.''<br>
<br>
Terra Systems, Inc. was incorporated in Utah in 1996 and is<br>
presently a development-stage company. It is primarily<br>
engaged in the development and commercialization of its<br>
patented Pneumatic Accelerator. This device is a gas linear<br>
particle accelerator, which conveys and processes bulk<br>
materials at high velocity in a particle-isolated state,<br>
using air as the medium of movement. This technology<br>
operates efficiently at ambient temperatures and at low<br>
pressures and does not use water, the generally more costly<br>
traditional alternative for processing bulk materials.<br>
Virtually, all organic and inorganic bulk materials used in<br>
basic industries can be more economically separated and<br>
classified by our dry-process technology. This capability<br>
facilitates a number of associated procedures, including:<br>
drying, micro pulverizing, mixing, forming, conveying, and<br>
loading. In addition, bulk materials can be beneficiated in<br>
important ways including moisture reduction, ash reduction,<br>
Btu enhancement, and electro-customization. Our system can<br>
perform multiple tasks, needs less maintenance, requires no<br>
chemical additives, and can improve the surrounding<br>
environmental quality. Opportunities are seen for many<br>
applications in an array of large industries including<br>
power generation, agriculture, mining, environment,<br>
construction, ceramics, and materials transportation.<br>
We estimate that our technology could generate economic<br>
returns to industrial users in the form of revenues and/or<br>
cost savings in the area of $2 billion within a few years,<br>
if adopted for implementation in several large projects.<br>
Terra Systems anticipates it will share in these economic<br>
returns through fees, royalties, and profit sharing from<br>
licensing of its technology. TSYI has approximately 18<br>
million shares currently outstanding.<br>

Your Work<br>
<br>
I have brought You glory on earth by completing the work You gave<br>
Me to do.<br>
- (John 17:4)<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord has revealed to us that the number one thing we are to<br>
do is love the Lord our God with all our heart and to love our<br>
neighbor as ourselves. His desire is for us to know Him and the<br>
power of His resurrection. These mandates deal with our<br>
relationship with Him. The fruit of this relationship must then<br>
result in our glorifying Him by completing the work He has given<br>
each of us to do. It will become a by-product of this<br>
relationship, not an end in itself.<br>
<br>
What is the work God has called you to do? Jesus never did<br>
anything the Father had not instructed Him to do. He lived in<br>
such communion with the Father that He knew when to turn left and<br>
when to turn to the right. Is it possible to have such a<br>
relationship with our heavenly Father? I think that if it<br>
weren't, He would not have given us such an example.<br>
<br>
&quot;Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and<br>
unsearchable things you do not know&quot; (Jer. 33:3). What has He<br>
called you to do? Perhaps you are called to be the best CPA in<br>
your city or the best advertising executive or the best office<br>
worker or assembly-line person in your company. Whatever work He<br>
has called you to do, He will use you as His instrument to<br>
accomplish something that He has uniquely prepared you to do.<br>
<br>
When our life is complete, what a glorious day it will be if we<br>
can each say, &quot;I have completed the work You gave me to do.&quot; This<br>
will have brought great glory to Him.<br>

EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE<br>
<br>
The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my<br>
distresses (Psalm 25:17).<br>
<br>
Unlike our day-to-day emotions which are the product of our<br>
day-to-day thought life, emotional baggage from the past is<br>
always there. Years of exposure and experience in life have<br>
etched grooves in our memory banks which are triggered by current<br>
events.<br>
<br>
For example, if your kind, loving grandfather was named Bill, you<br>
probably have a favorable emotional reaction to other people<br>
named Bill. But if the school bully was named Bill, your initial<br>
reaction to the Bills in your life is probably negative. If your<br>
spouse suggests, &quot;Let's name our first child Bill,&quot; you might<br>
even react, &quot;Over my dead body!&quot;<br>
<br>
I call these long-term emotions which lurk beneath the surface<br>
primary emotions. The intensity of your primary emotions is<br>
determined by your previous life history. The more traumatic your<br>
experience, the more intense will be your primary emotion. Many<br>
of these primary emotions will lie dormant and have very little<br>
effect on your life until something comes along to trigger them.<br>
Have you ever brought up a topic of conversation which upset<br>
someone and sent him storming out of the room? &quot;What set him<br>
off?&quot; you wondered. He was &quot;set off&quot; because a bad experience in<br>
his past was triggered by your topic. The trigger is any present<br>
event which he associates with the past conflict.<br>
<br>
Most people try to control their primary emotions by avoiding the<br>
people or events which trigger them. But you can't isolate<br>
yourself completely from everything which may set off a response.<br>
You are bound to see something on TV or hear something in a<br>
conversation which will bring to mind your unpleasant experience.<br>
You must learn how to resolve previous conflicts or the emotional<br>
baggage will accumulate and the past will control your life.<br>
<br>
During the next few days, we will consider ways to resolve our<br>
emotional baggage from the past.<br>
<br>
Lord, I don't want to be controlled by past events. Show me how I<br>
can resolve these issues so I can walk in freedom today.<br>

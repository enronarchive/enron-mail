SING AND MAKE MELODY<br>
<br>
Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and<br>
hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your<br>
heart to the Lord (Ephesians 5:18, 19).<br>
<br>
How pathetically unaware we are of the biblical prominence of<br>
music in the spiritual realm. It is interesting to note that<br>
whenever the evil spirit came upon King Saul, David (the heir<br>
apparent to Israel's throne) would play his harp and the evil<br>
spirit would depart (1 Samuel 16:23). When Elisha was about to<br>
inquire of God, he said, &quot;'Now bring me a minstrel.' And it came<br>
about, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came<br>
upon him&quot; (2 Kings 3:15). During the reign of David, more than<br>
4000 musicians were assigned to sing in the temple night and day<br>
(1 Chronicles 9:33; 23:5). It is the mark of Spirit-filled<br>
Christians to sing and make melody in their hearts to the Lord<br>
and speak to each other in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs<br>
(Ephesians 5:18, 19).<br>
<br>
On the other side of the truth lies the destructive power of<br>
secular music. A former satanic high priest showed me numerous<br>
symbols on popular record albums indicating commitment and<br>
bondage to Satanism. He told me that about 85 percent of today's<br>
heavy metal and punk music groups are &quot;owned&quot; by Satanists. They<br>
have unwittingly sold themselves to Satanism in exchange for fame<br>
and fortune. Few of these artists actually practice Satanism, but<br>
most are hopelessly lost and lead others astray through the<br>
godless message in their music.<br>
<br>
God created sound and formed our bodies to respond to it. Our<br>
ears pick up the sound around us and send a signal to the brain.<br>
Some sounds irritate us; others soothe us. There is music that<br>
makes you want to march and music that puts you to sleep. Even<br>
without lyrics, music with harmony and order can affect the<br>
nervous system positively while discord produces a negative<br>
effect.<br>
<br>
What role does music play in your life? Are you filling your mind<br>
and home with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs? Or are you<br>
allowing destructive secular music to rob you of your joy and<br>
vitality in the Lord?<br>
<br>
You are the God who sings over me, Lord. Thank You for the gift<br>
of music and for the songs You give me in the night.<br>

WITH ALL PRAYER AND PETITION<br>
<br>
With all prayer and petition, pray at all times in the Spirit,<br>
and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and<br>
petition for all the saints (Ephesians 6:18).<br>
<br>
The mother of one of my seminary students was a psychic. She said<br>
to him once, &quot;Jim, have you been praying for me?&quot; &quot;Of course I<br>
have, Mother.&quot; &quot;Well, don't,&quot; she insisted, &quot;because you're<br>
disturbing my aura.&quot;<br>
<br>
I say pray on! We never know completely the effects of our<br>
prayers, but we do know that God includes prayer as part of His<br>
strategy for establishing His kingdom and ensuring our spiritual<br>
victory.<br>
<br>
One of the most dramatic deliverances I have observed happened in<br>
a man who was a high priest in the upper echelons of Satanism.<br>
Six months after he was set free he gave his testimony in our<br>
church. At the close of his testimony I asked him, &quot;Based on your<br>
experience on 'the other side,' what is the Christian's greatest<br>
strategy against demonic influence?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Prayer,&quot; he answered forcefully. &quot;And when you pray, mean it.<br>
Fervent prayer thwarts Satan's activity like nothing else.&quot;<br>
<br>
What is prayer? It is communication with God by which we express<br>
our dependence on Him. God knows what we need in our battle with<br>
the powers of darkness, and He is more ready to meet our needs<br>
than we are to ask. But until we express our dependence on Him in<br>
prayer, God may not act. In prayer we say, &quot;You are the Lord, not<br>
I. You know what's best; I don't. I'm not telling You what to do;<br>
I'm asking.&quot; Prayer is a means by which God guides and protects<br>
His children.<br>
<br>
Praying in the Spirit is God's way of helping us pray when we<br>
don't know how: &quot;The Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do<br>
not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself<br>
intercedes for us&quot; (Romans 8:26). Helps (sunantilambano) depicts<br>
the Holy Spirit's role of coming alongside us in our condition of<br>
human frailty and spiritual vulnerability and bearing us to the<br>
other side of spiritual protection and victory.<br>
<br>
Thank You, Lord, that prayer is such a powerful weapon in my<br>
arsenal against the powers of darkness.<br>

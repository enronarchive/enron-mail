FORGIVING YOUR PAST<br>
<br>
Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other,<br>
just as God in Christ also has forgiven you (Ephesians 4:32).<br>
<br>
The second step in resolving past conflicts is to forgive those<br>
who have offended you. After encouraging Cindy, a rape victim, to<br>
deal with the emotional trauma of her rape, I said, &quot;Cindy, you<br>
also need to forgive the man who raped you.&quot; Cindy's response was<br>
typical of many believers who have suffered physical, sexual or<br>
emotional pain at the hands of others: &quot;Why should I forgive him?<br>
You don't know how badly he hurt me!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He's still hurting you, Cindy,&quot; I responded. &quot;Forgiveness is how<br>
you stop the pain. You don't forgive him for his sake; you do it<br>
for your sake.&quot;<br>
<br>
Why should you forgive those who have hurt you in the past?<br>
<br>
First, forgiveness is required by God. As soon as Jesus spoke the<br>
amen to His model prayer--which included a petition for God's<br>
forgiveness--He commented: &quot;If you forgive men for their<br>
transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But<br>
if you do not forgive men, then your Father will not forgive your<br>
transgressions&quot; (Matthew 6:14, 15). We must base our<br>
relationships with others on the same criteria on which God bases<br>
His relationship with us: love, acceptance and forgiveness<br>
(Matthew 18:21-35).<br>
<br>
Second, forgiveness is necessary to avoid entrapment by Satan. I<br>
have discovered from my counseling that unforgiveness is the<br>
number one avenue Satan uses to gain entrance to believers'<br>
lives. Paul encouraged mutual forgiveness &quot;in order that no<br>
advantage be taken of us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his<br>
schemes&quot; (2 Corinthians 2:11). Unforgiveness is an open<br>
invitation to Satan's bondage in our lives.<br>
<br>
Third, we are to forgive like Christ forgave in order to keep our<br>
hearts from bitterness. Paul wrote: &quot;Let all bitterness and wrath<br>
and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with<br>
all malice. And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving<br>
each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you&quot;<br>
(Ephesians 4:31, 32).<br>
<br>
Your act of forgiveness will set the captive free, then you will<br>
realize that the captive was you!<br>
<br>
Lord, teach me to forgive others from my heart as You have<br>
forgiven me.<br>

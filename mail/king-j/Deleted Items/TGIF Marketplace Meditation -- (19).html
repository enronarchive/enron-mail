Knowledge That is Productive<br>
<br>
For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they<br>
will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your<br>
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
- (2 Peter 1:8)<br>
<br>
<br>
Productivity is a term all businesspeople can relate to. It is<br>
the by-product of what we desire from our work. Without<br>
productivity, we do not make sales, we do not deliver goods, we<br>
do not achieve our goals. There are things in our business lives<br>
that can creep in making us unproductive. The same is true in our<br>
walk with God.<br>
<br>
The apostle Peter tells us that we can become knowledgeable of<br>
Jesus but fail to be effective and productive in our relationship<br>
with Him. We are a society that has great knowledge, but our<br>
comparable scale of productivity from that knowledge is extremely<br>
weighted to the knowledge side. The apostle Peter tells us there<br>
is a solution to this dilemma.<br>
<br>
For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith<br>
goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge,<br>
self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to<br>
perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness;<br>
and to brotherly kindness, love. For if you possess these<br>
qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being<br>
ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus<br>
Christ (2 Peter 1:5-8).<br>
<br>
Is your Christian experience filled with knowledge, but little<br>
power? Is there a staleness in your walk with God? Is there an<br>
unrest in your soul? It may be due to a need to develop character<br>
that only the Holy Spirit can develop out of an obedient heart.<br>
Ask the Lord today to add these qualities to your faith so that<br>
you can be productive as a soldier of Jesus Christ.<br>

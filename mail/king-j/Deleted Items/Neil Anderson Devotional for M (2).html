THE PROCESS OF FORGIVENESS<br>
<br>
Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who<br>
curse you, pray for those who mistreat you (Luke 6:27, 28).<br>
<br>
Here are 12 simple steps you can use to walk through the process<br>
of forgiving someone who hurt you in the past.<br>
<br>
  1 Ask the Lord to reveal the names of the persons who offended<br>
    you and the specific wrongs you suffered.<br>
<br>
  2 Face the hurt and the hate. If you are going to forgive from<br>
    your heart, you must let God search the depths of your heart.<br>
<br>
  3 Acknowledge the significance of the cross. It is the cross of<br>
    Christ that makes forgiveness legally and morally right.<br>
<br>
  4 Decide that you will not retaliate by using the information<br>
    about the offender's sin against them (Luke 6:27-34).<br>
  5 Decide to forgive. Forgiveness is a conscious choice to let<br>
    the other person off the hook and free yourself from the<br>
    past.<br>
<br>
  6 Take your list of names to God and pray the following: &quot;I<br>
    forgive ___(name)___ for ___(specifically identify every<br>
    remembered pain)__.&quot;<br>
<br>
  7 Destroy the list. You are now free. Do not tell the offenders<br>
    what you have done. Your forgiveness is between you and God<br>
    unless the offenders have asked you for forgiveness.<br>
<br>
  8 Do not expect that your decision to forgive will result in<br>
    major changes in the other persons. Instead, pray for them<br>
    (Matthew 5:44).<br>
<br>
  9 Try to understand the people you have forgiven. They are<br>
    victims also.<br>
<br>
  10Freedom is a result of forgiveness in you. In time you will<br>
    be able to think about the people who offended you without<br>
    feeling hurt or anger.<br>
<br>
  11Thank God for the lessons you have learned and the maturity<br>
    you have gained.<br>
<br>
  12When appropriate, accept your part of the blame for the<br>
    offenses you suffered. Confess your failure to God and to<br>
    others (1 John 1:9) and realize that if someone has something<br>
    against you, you must go to that person (Matthew 5:23-26).<br>
<br>
Lord, teach me how to love unconditionally and forgive quickly<br>
those who hate me, curse me or mistreat me.<br>

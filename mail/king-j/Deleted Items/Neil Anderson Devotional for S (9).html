BELIEVE IN GOD<br>
<br>
Without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to<br>
God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those<br>
who seek Him (Hebrews 11:6).<br>
<br>
The life of Wilma Rudolph, the great Olympic sprinter, is a<br>
remarkable story of faith. Wilma was born with health problems<br>
that left her crippled. &quot;Will I ever be able to run and play like<br>
the other children?&quot; Wilma asked her parents.<br>
<br>
&quot;Honey, you have to believe in God and never give up hope,&quot; they<br>
responded. &quot;If you believe, God will make it happen.&quot; Taking her<br>
parents' counsel, she painfully struggled to walk. By the time<br>
she was 12, to the delight and surprise of many, Wilma no longer<br>
needed her braces. She went on to play basketball on her<br>
championship high school team and win three gold medals in the<br>
1960 Olympics.<br>
<br>
When you hear inspiring stories of faith like Wilma Rudolph's, do<br>
you sometimes wonder, &quot;What could I accomplish if I took God at<br>
His Word?&quot; Faith is the foundational principle of the Christian<br>
life. Believing who God is, what He says, what He has done, and<br>
what He will do defines the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, faith is the essence of the Christian's day-to-day<br>
activity. Paul wrote: &quot;As you therefore have received Christ<br>
Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him&quot; (Colossians 2:6). How did you<br>
receive Christ? By faith. How then are you to walk in Him? By<br>
faith. In Scripture, walking refers to the way you conduct your<br>
everyday life. Victorious Christian living and spiritual maturity<br>
are determined by our belief in God.<br>
<br>
We tend to think of faith as some kind of mystical quality which<br>
belongs only in the realm of the spiritual. But everybody walks<br>
by faith. It is the most basic operating principle of life. The<br>
question is, in what or in whom do you believe? We are challenged<br>
to believe in God and take His Word seriously.<br>
<br>
Thank You, Lord, that Your Word stands forever in heaven. I can<br>
trust in You and Your Word despite my changing feelings and<br>
circumstances.<br>

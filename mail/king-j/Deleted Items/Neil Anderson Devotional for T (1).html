THE PEACE OF GOD<br>
<br>
Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world<br>
gives, do I give to you (John 14:27).<br>
<br>
Peace on earth--that's what everybody wants. But nobody can<br>
guarantee external peace because nobody can control other people<br>
or circumstances. Nations sign and break peace treaties with<br>
frightening regularity. Couples lament that there would be peace<br>
in their home &quot;if only he/she would shape up.&quot; No one can<br>
guarantee peace at home or on the job site. However, we should<br>
always strive to be peacemakers. Jesus said, &quot;Blessed are the<br>
peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God&quot; (Matthew 5:9).<br>
Paul instructed, &quot;If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at<br>
peace with all men&quot; (Romans 12:18).<br>
<br>
But let's face it: Peace with others isn't always possible,<br>
because peace doesn't just depend on us. Peace on earth is what<br>
we want; peace with God is what we have; the peace of God is what<br>
we need.<br>
<br>
Peace with God is something you already have (Romans 5:1). It's<br>
not something you strive for; it's something you received when<br>
you were born again. The Prince of Peace reconciled you to God by<br>
shedding His own blood.<br>
<br>
The peace of God is something you need to appropriate daily in<br>
your inner world in the midst of the storms which rage in the<br>
external world (John 14:27). There are a lot of things that can<br>
disrupt your external world because you can't control all your<br>
circumstances and relationships. But you can control the inner<br>
world of your thoughts by allowing the peace of Christ to rule in<br>
your heart on a daily basis (Colossians 3:15). There may be chaos<br>
all around you, but God is bigger than any storm. I keep a little<br>
plaque on my desk which reminds me: &quot;Nothing will happen to me<br>
today that God and I cannot resolve.&quot;<br>
<br>
The peace of Christ will rule in your heart when you &quot;let the<br>
word of Christ richly dwell within you&quot; (Colossians 3:16). And<br>
when you turn to Him in prayer, &quot;the peace of God, which<br>
surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and your<br>
minds in Christ Jesus&quot; (Philippians 4:7).<br>
<br>
Prince of Peace, rule in my heart today. Give me Your peace and<br>
make me a peacemaker in all my relationships.<br>

The Value of Words<br>
<br>
And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair<br>
white or black. Simply let your &quot;Yes&quot; be &quot;Yes,&quot; and your &quot;No,&quot;<br>
&quot;No&quot;; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.<br>
- (Matthew 5:36-37)<br>
<br>
<br>
Imagine for a moment that you are living in Jesus' time. It is<br>
before Jesus has begun His public ministry. He is a carpenter in<br>
your local town of Nazareth. You have asked Jesus to make a table<br>
for you. You're on a deadline and you must have it in a week. You<br>
agree on the price of for the table and the date of one week for<br>
completion. A week later you arrive to pick up the table. You lay<br>
your money down on the table and Jesus says, &quot;Mr. Johnson, I am<br>
sorry but the table is not ready. I ran into complications. Also,<br>
I can no longer honor the price I gave you. It is now instead of<br>
.&quot;<br>
<br>
Two years later you hear about this same Jesus who is preaching<br>
to the local townspeople. How are you going to view this Jesus?<br>
You probably won't give much credence to His message because of<br>
your personal experience. Our lives have an ability to reinforce<br>
the message we stand for, or they can violate it and make it<br>
totally ineffective. This literally happens all over the world in<br>
different settings with Christian businesspeople. Our message<br>
becomes ineffective because we have not done what we said.<br>
<br>
I know people who, when they tell me they plan to do something, I<br>
can expect them to follow through about 50 percent of the time. I<br>
am sure you have had the same experience. Words and commitments<br>
are made with little meaning behind those words. However, I know<br>
others who will follow through almost every time. The only time<br>
they don't is when something falls outside their control. I<br>
quickly learn whose words have substance behind them.<br>
<br>
There are times when we are unable to perform or deliver what we<br>
promised due to outside influences. The key to turning these<br>
potentially negative circumstances into a witness for Christ is<br>
communication. If we are unable to pay a bill on time, we must<br>
communicate with those we owe and make a good faith effort to<br>
resolve it within our means. In these cases, God's purposes are<br>
being performed as well if we seek to do the right thing.<br>
<br>
Do your words mean anything to those who hear them? Do you make<br>
commitments and fail to follow through on them? What would others<br>
say about how you follow through? Ask the Lord today to show you<br>
how you are doing in this area. You might even want to ask three<br>
people who are the closest to you how you fare in this area.<br>

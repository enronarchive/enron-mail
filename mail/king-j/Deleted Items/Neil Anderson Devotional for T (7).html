OUR ESSENTIAL IDENTITY<br>
<br>
Then God said, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our<br>
likeness&quot; (Genesis 1:26).<br>
<br>
Adam was created physically and spiritually alive. He possessed<br>
eternal life from his first breath and enjoyed God's abiding<br>
presence in the Garden of Eden.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, unlike the animal kingdom that operated by divine<br>
instinct, Adam was created in the likeness of God with a mind,<br>
emotions and will, giving him the ability to think, feel and<br>
choose. No other created being can make that claim.<br>
<br>
After creating Adam, God said, &quot;It is not good for the man to be<br>
alone&quot; (Genesis 2:18). So He created a suitable helper for him:<br>
Eve. They both enjoyed a sense of belonging to God and each<br>
other. Not only that, God gave them a purpose: to &quot;rule over the<br>
fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle<br>
and over all the earth&quot; (Genesis 1:26). Adam and Eve didn't have<br>
to search for significance; they had it in their relationship<br>
with God. And because God was present with them, they lived in<br>
perpetual safety and security.<br>
<br>
Eternal life, identity, purpose, significance, security and a<br>
sense of belonging are all attributes of mankind created in the<br>
image of God. Adam and Eve experienced these attributes in full<br>
measure, and we were destined to enjoy them too. But when Adam<br>
sinned, he died spiritually and forfeited everything God had<br>
provided. Being separated from God, Adam's glowing attributes<br>
became glaring needs.<br>
<br>
As children of Adam born separated from God, we come into the<br>
world with these same glaring needs. We wander though life<br>
striving to make a name of ourselves, looking for security in<br>
temporal things, and searching for significance apart from God.<br>
Is it a hopeless quest? No! We are able to fulfill these needs by<br>
establishing a personal relationship with God through faith in<br>
Jesus Christ. Everything Adam enjoyed in the garden before he<br>
sinned is now at our disposal.<br>
<br>
Loving heavenly Father, thank You for sending Jesus to die for my<br>
sin so I may have eternal life. And thank You that in Christ my<br>
need for identity, significance, security and a sense of<br>
belonging can be met.<br>

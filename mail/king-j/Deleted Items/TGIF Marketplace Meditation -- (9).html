Sacrificing at What Cost<br>
<br>
...&quot;I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that<br>
cost me nnothing.&quot;<br>
- (2 Samuel 24:24)<br>
<br>
<br>
One day I was having lunch with a man who had a certain amount of<br>
notoriety in his life. After a time of getting to know each<br>
other, he said, &quot;How can I help you?&quot; Those words surprised me<br>
coming from a man who obviously already had many requirements on<br>
his time. My first thought was that I was impressed with the<br>
individual. My next thought was to wonder whether it was a<br>
genuine offer or just an effort to impress me with his humility<br>
and Christian piety. I have since discovered he was sincere.<br>
<br>
This encounter reminded me that each of us must be willing to<br>
give to others without a motive to get anything in return. It is<br>
simply an act of serving others. Jesus said that we must consider<br>
others more important than ourselves. When is the last time you<br>
did something for another without a motive of getting anything in<br>
return?<br>
<br>
When King David came to offer a sacrifice and pray for the<br>
removal of a plague on Israel, he was given the opportunity to<br>
make the sacrifice without the cost of purchasing the sacrificial<br>
animals.<br>
<br>
But the king replied to Araunah, &quot;No, I insist on paying you for<br>
it. I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that<br>
cost me nothing.&quot; So David bought the threshing floor and the<br>
oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them. David built an<br>
altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and<br>
fellowship offerings. Then the Lord answered prayer in behalf of<br>
the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped (2 Samuel<br>
24:24-25).<br>
<br>
David, understanding the principle of giving, said he could not<br>
offer anything to God that did not cost him something. Otherwise,<br>
it was not a sacrificial gift.<br>
<br>
When is the last time you sacrificed for another that it cost you<br>
something with no expectation of getting anything in return? We<br>
can all give something to others, such as our time, our money, or<br>
our expertise. This is real Christianity that models the Spirit<br>
of Christ. The next time you meet with someone, why not consider<br>
how you might be a blessing to that person. Why not ask, &quot;How can<br>
I help you?&quot;<br>

Comparing the 16,197,039 common shares of PC EPHONE<br>
outstanding as of October 31, 2001 with the market<br>
capitalization of a company such as PALM, this is a stock<br>
that really could be about to fly.<br>
<br>
With news of carrier approval expected soon, there could be<br>
a huge win here. PCPH was over $6 earlier this year and<br>
that was well before all the recent exciting events.<br>

Readers are cautioned that small and micro-cap stocks are<br>
high-risk investments and that they may lose all or a<br>
portion of their investment if they make a purchase in our<br>
advertised stocks. In order to be in full compliance with<br>
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(b), we have<br>
received 40,000 free trading shares of PC EPhone, Inc. from<br>
a third party as compensation for the distribution of this<br>
and other advertisements. Since we have received<br>
compensation and hold stock in the advertised company there<br>
is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and<br>
opinions and such statements and opinions cannot be<br>
considered independent. We will benefit from any increase<br>
in share price of the advertised company. We will sell our<br>
shares at any time, without notice, be that before, during<br>
or immediately after the release of this advertisement. The<br>
liquidation of our stock may have a negative impact on the<br>
securities of the company liquidated, including decreased<br>
market value and/or dilution of the company's securities.<br>
Furthermore, our associates and/or employees and/or<br>
principals may have stock positions in advertised companies<br>
purchased in the open market or in private transactions.<br>
These positions may be liquidated, without prior<br>
notification, even after we have made positive comments<br>
regarding the advertised company. It should be understood<br>
that any price targets and/or projections mentioned are<br>
solely opinions and should not be taken as suggested<br>
holding periods. In fact, we will sell our positions in any<br>
companies advertised before they reach such target prices.<br>

of these terms and conditions. Reading this advertisement<br>
shall not create under any circumstances an offer to buy or<br>

any principal-agent relationship between the reader and us.<br>
The stocks of advertised companies may trade in fast<br>
moving, highly volatile markets, and any reader should<br>
observe the trading behavior of any advertised company<br>
prior to investing. Advertised stocks are often thinly<br>
traded and large sell orders will have a substantially<br>
negative impact on share price. Investors in advertised<br>
stocks may experience difficulty in selling shares without<br>
seeing a decline in market price and may have difficulty in<br>
finding ready buyers of their stock. Information within<br>
this advertisement contains &quot;forward looking&quot; statements<br>
within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the U.S. Securities<br>
Act of 1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities<br>
Exchange Act of 1934. Any statements that express or<br>
involve discussions with respect to predictions,<br>
expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives,<br>
goals, assumptions or future events or performance are not<br>
statements of historical facts and may be forward looking<br>
statements. Forward looking statements are based on<br>
expectations, estimates and projections at the time the<br>
statements are made that involve a number of risks and<br>
uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to<br>
differ materially from those presently anticipated. Forward<br>
looking statements may be identified through the use of<br>
words such as expects, will, anticipates, estimates,<br>
believes, or by statements indicating certain actions may,<br>
could or might occur. We encourage our readers to invest<br>
carefully and read the investor information available at<br>
the web sites of the U.S. Securities and Exchange<br>
Commission (SEC) at http://www.sec.gov and the National<br>
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) at<br>

read the SEC advisory to investors concerning Internet<br>
Stock Fraud, which can be found at<br>
http://www.sec.gov/consumer/cyberfr.htm. The NASD has<br>
published information on how to invest carefully at its web<br>
site. Readers can review all public filings by companies at<br>
the SEC s EDGAR page. All information within this<br>
advertisement is qualified in its entirety by the detailed<br>

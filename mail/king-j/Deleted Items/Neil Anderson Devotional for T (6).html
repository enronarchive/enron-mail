IDENTIFYING A CHRISTIAN LEADER<br>
<br>
There will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly<br>
introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who<br>
bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves (2 Peter<br>
2:1).<br>
<br>
What comes to mind when you hear the terms false prophets and<br>
false teachers? Many people tend to thing of Eastern mystics and<br>
gurus, the spokespersons for nonbiblical religions or dynamic<br>
cult leaders--people who are recognizably outside the boundaries<br>
of the Christian church. But the apostle Peter devoted an entire<br>
chapter in one of his letters (2 Peter 2) to false prophets and<br>
teachers who operate within the church. False teachers may<br>
operate in our churches disguised as workers of righteousness.<br>
<br>
Notice that the lure of false teachers is not primarily their<br>
doctrine: &quot;And many will follow their sensuality, and because of<br>
them the way of the truth will be maligned&quot; (verse 2). What does<br>
Peter mean by &quot;follow their sensuality&quot;? He is talking about<br>
Christians who evaluate a ministry based on the outward<br>
appearance and charm of its leaders. We say, &quot;He's such a nice<br>
guy&quot;; &quot;She's a very charismatic person&quot;; &quot;He's a real dynamic<br>
speaker&quot;; &quot;She's so sweet and sounds so sincere.&quot; But is physical<br>
attractiveness or a syrupy personality a biblical criterion for<br>
validating a ministry or a teacher? Of course not! The issue is<br>
always truth and righteousness. A Christian leader should be<br>
identified by his commitment to the truth, his righteous life and<br>
his servant's heart.<br>
<br>
Dear God, keep me from playing to the grandstand; I want only to<br>
live for You. Keep me accountable as a person of truth,<br>
righteousness, and love, ever fearful of discrediting Your name.<br>

THE BELIEVER'S TENT<br>
<br>
Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground and breathed<br>
into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living<br>
being (Genesis 2:7).<br>
<br>
Biblically, life means to unite and death means to separate. When<br>
Adam became a living being, his soul was in union with his body.<br>
When he died, his soul separated from his body.<br>
<br>
As long as you are alive, your soul is united with your body. But<br>
when that separation occurs, you do not cease to exist. Paul said<br>
that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord (2<br>
Corinthians 5:8). Your primary identity is not found in your<br>
physical existence. Paul said, &quot;From now on we recognize no man<br>
according to the flesh&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:16).<br>
<br>
Even though your principal identity is more than physical, in<br>
this temporal life you cannot function without your physical<br>
body. Your immaterial self needs your material self, and vice<br>
versa. You need your physical brain to control your movements and<br>
responses, and you need your immaterial mind to reason and make<br>
value judgments. Your brain is like a computer and your mind is<br>
the programmer. The finest human brain can't accomplish anything<br>
in a corpse which lacks a mind. And the most brilliant mind<br>
cannot function in a brain damaged by Alzheimer's disease.<br>
<br>
In 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 Paul referred to the believer's body as a<br>
tent, the temporary dwelling place of the soul. Using his<br>
illustration, I must confess that my tent pegs are coming up, my<br>
poles are sagging, and my seams are becoming frayed! At my age<br>
I'm just glad that there's more to me than the disposable earth<br>
suit I walk around in.<br>
<br>
You don't exist for your body; it exists for you. That's why Paul<br>
said, &quot;I beat my body and make it my slave&quot; (1 Corinthians 9:27<br>
NIV). In order to fulfill your purpose for being here, you need<br>
to manage your body well through exercise, balanced diet and<br>
adequate rest.<br>
<br>
Lord, help me to not overemphasize or underemphasize the<br>
significance of my physical life but stay in step with Your view.<br>

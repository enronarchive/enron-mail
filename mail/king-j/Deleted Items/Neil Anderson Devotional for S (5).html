THE OLDEST LIE OF SATAN<br>
<br>
They sacrificed to demons who were not God, to gods whom they<br>
have not known, new gods who came lately, whom your fathers did<br>
not dread. You neglected the Rock who begot you, and forgot the<br>
God who gave you birth (Deuteronomy 32:17, 18).<br>
<br>
The New Age Movement cloaks the occult in the description of New<br>
Age enlightenment: &quot;You don't need God; you are God. You don't<br>
need to repent of your sins and depend on God to save you. Sin<br>
isn't a problem; you just need to turn off your mind and tune in<br>
to the great cosmic oneness through harmonic convergence.&quot; The<br>
New Age pitch is the oldest lie of Satan: &quot;You will be like God&quot;<br>
(Genesis 3:5).<br>
<br>
This thirst for knowledge and power has lured a fallen humanity<br>
to seek guidance from mediums and spiritists, and from such<br>
occultic practices as fortune-telling, tarot cards, palm-reading,<br>
Ouija boards, astrology, magic charming and automatic writing.<br>
People all around us are ignoring the God who loves them and<br>
wants to guide their lives and are instead seeking light and<br>
peace in the kingdom of darkness. Peace can only be found in the<br>
Prince of Peace, not in the prince of darkness.<br>
<br>
Don't be carried away by the prospect of knowledge and power<br>
which is luring so many people in our culture today away from<br>
God. People such as the devotees of Simon in Acts 8:9, 10, will<br>
continue to be astonished by those who practice New Age sorcery.<br>
Others, such as the customers of the demon-possessed slave girl<br>
in Acts 16:16-18, will contribute to the profit of those who<br>
exercise a spirit of divination. As in these examples from the<br>
early church, those who seek knowledge and power from the dark<br>
side will greatly interfere with the work of God, deceiving many<br>
by the counterfeit forces they employ. Other people will thirst<br>
after power to such an extent that they will sacrifice to the<br>
&quot;goat demons&quot; (Leviticus 17:7) and even sacrifice their own<br>
children to demons (Psalm 106:36-38).<br>
<br>
Let the words of Deuteronomy 32:17, 18, sober us to the reality<br>
that even believers are vulnerable to being lured away from the<br>
knowledge and power of God by our enemy.<br>
<br>
Lord, I refuse to participate with the powers of darkness. You<br>
are my life and the light of my world.<br>

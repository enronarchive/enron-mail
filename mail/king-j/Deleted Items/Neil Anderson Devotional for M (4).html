             from Freedom in Christ Ministries<br>
<br>
<br>
Having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace<br>
(Ephesians 6:15).<br>
<br>
The next piece of armor is the shoes of peace. When you receive<br>
Christ, you are united with the Prince of Peace. You have peace<br>
with God right now (Romans 5:1), but the peace of Christ must<br>
also rule in your heart if you are going to live victoriously,<br>
and that is possible only when you let the Word of Christ richly<br>
dwell in you (Colossians 3:15, 16).<br>
<br>
The shoes of peace become protection against the divisive schemes<br>
of the devil when you act as a peacemaker among believers (Romans<br>
14:19). Peacemakers bring people together by promoting fellowship<br>
and reconciliation. &quot;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall<br>
be called sons of God&quot; (Matthew 5:9). Anyone can divide a<br>
fellowship, but it takes the grace of God to unite us in Him.<br>
<br>
Too many Christians insist on common doctrine as the basis for<br>
fellowship. They reason that if we don't think the same and<br>
believe the same, there is no basis for peace. But common<br>
doctrine isn't the basis for fellowship; common heritage is.<br>
We're all children of God. If you wait to fellowship with someone<br>
until you agree perfectly on every point of doctrine, you'll be<br>
the loneliest Christian on earth. Instead of insisting on the<br>
unity of the mind, preserve the unity of the Spirit by taking the<br>
initiative to be the peacemaker in your relationships (Ephesians<br>
4:3).<br>
<br>
Some people like to play the devil's advocate in their<br>
relationships and churches. I ask, Why? He doesn't need any help!<br>
In His high priestly prayer, Jesus prayed, &quot;I in them, and Thou<br>
in Me, that they may be perfected in unity, that the world may<br>
know that Thou didst send Me&quot; (John 17:23). We have the promise<br>
that &quot;the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet&quot;<br>
(Romans 16:20). Ask God to use you to bring unity to your<br>
relationships by making you a peacemaker.<br>
<br>
Heavenly Father, use me today to bring unity to Your family.<br>
Enable me to be a peacemaker.<br>

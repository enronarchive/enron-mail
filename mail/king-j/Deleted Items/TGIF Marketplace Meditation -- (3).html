<br>
The Skillful Worker<br>
<br>
Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings;<br>
he will not serve before obscure men.<br>
- (Proverbs 22:29)<br>
<br>
<br>
The Lord has called each of us to be excellent in what we do.<br>
Those whom God used in the Kingdom as marketplace ministers were<br>
skilled and exemplified excellence in their field. Not only were<br>
these men skilled, they were filled with God's Spirit.<br>
<br>
Then the Lord said to Moses, &quot;See, I have chosen Bezalel son of<br>
Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, and I have filled him<br>
with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all<br>
kinds of crafts-to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver<br>
and bronze, to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage<br>
in all kinds of craftsmanship&quot; (Exodus 31:1-5).<br>
<br>
Consider Huram, the master craftsman of bronze in whom Solomon<br>
entrusted much of the temple designs. He was a true master<br>
craftsman (see 1 Kings 7:14).<br>
<br>
Consider Joseph, whose skill as an administrator was known<br>
throughout Egypt and the world. Consider Daniel, who served his<br>
king with great skill and integrity. The list could go on-David,<br>
Nehemiah, Acquilla and Priscilla.<br>
<br>
I recall the first issue of an international publication we<br>
began. It was common to hear the comment, &quot;It doesn't even look<br>
like a Christian magazine.&quot; They were saying the quality and<br>
excellence exceeded what they equated to Christian work. What a<br>
shame. Has inferior quality become synonymous with Christian<br>
work?<br>
<br>
May we strive for excellence in all that we do for the Master of<br>
the universe.<br>
<br>
Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for<br>
the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an<br>
inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you<br>
are serving (Colossians 3:23-24).<br>

<br>
How can you experience God in your work? Why do most of us<br>
tend to segment our spiritual life from our work life? Can<br>
I really know God's will for my life? How can I make<br>
decisions that will be blessed by God? Why do most Christians<br>
in the workplace live a defeated life? Join Os and Angie<br>
Hillman for the Called to the Workplace one day workshop and<br>
find these answers along with many more October 26,27 in<br>
Columbia, SC<br>

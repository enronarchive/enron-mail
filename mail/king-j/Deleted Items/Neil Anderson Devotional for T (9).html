SEEKING GOD'S FACE<br>
<br>
My heart says of you, &quot;Seek His face!&quot; Your face, LORD, I will<br>
seek (Psalm 27:8 NIV).<br>
<br>
&quot;If the sun is shining in the morning, I'll do it.&quot; &quot;If he's<br>
there when I open the door, I'll know he's the one.&quot; &quot;If I pass<br>
the class on world missions, I'll be a missionary. If not, I'll<br>
be a local pastor.&quot;<br>
<br>
We all know better than this, but it's amazing how often<br>
scenarios just like these pop into our minds. Such propositions<br>
are referred to as &quot;laying a fleece&quot; before the Lord or &quot;seeking<br>
a sign.&quot;<br>
<br>
The term fleece comes from the account of Gideon. In Judges 6,<br>
Gideon is called by God to deliver Israel from the Midianites.<br>
Gideon questions whether God is even for Israel (verse 13), and<br>
he doubts his own ability (verse 15). So he asks God for a sign<br>
(verse 17). God gives him one, then tells him to tear down the<br>
altar of Baal. Gideon is afraid to go during the day, so he goes<br>
at night.<br>
<br>
Then he questions again whether God will deliver Israel. This<br>
time he puts a lamb's fleece on the ground. If God will deliver<br>
Israel, then the lamb's fleece will be wet in the morning and the<br>
ground around it will be dry. The next morning it is so. That<br>
ought to satisfy him, right? Wrong! Wanting to be sure, and<br>
hoping that God won't get too mad, Gideon asks Him to do it<br>
again, but this time with the opposite result (i.e., the fleece<br>
dry and the ground wet). Not exactly the stuff heroes are made<br>
of. But God answers Gideon's request and then He reduces Gideon's<br>
army down to 300 men!<br>
<br>
The whole point of the passage is that God, not man, is the<br>
deliverer. God chose a man desperately seeking assurance and<br>
reduced an army down to nothing so that the victory would clearly<br>
be His. The fleece wasn't a means of demonstrating faith; it was<br>
just the opposite. And it certainly wasn't used to determine<br>
God's will. God had already told Gideon what to do. Gideon was<br>
questioning the integrity of God, just as we do if we ask for a<br>
fleece when God has already shown us His will. &quot;An evil and<br>
adulterous generation craves for a sign&quot; (Matthew 12:39). As<br>
God's people, let's seek the face of God.<br>
<br>
Lord, forgive me for the times I have looked for sign instead of<br>
seeking Your face. I commit myself today to walk only in the<br>
faith revealed in Your Word.<br>

Four Attributes of a Life God Blesses<br>
<br>
So this is what the Sovereign Lord says: &quot;See, I lay a stone in<br>
Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure<br>
foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed.&quot;<br>
- (Isaiah 28:16)<br>
<br>
<br>
Whenever God calls us into a consecrated life, it is made up of<br>
four distinct stages. Christ often compared this process to<br>
building a house. First, we must prepare to build by laying a<br>
foundation. That foundation is none other than Jesus Christ<br>
Himself. Any foundation other than Christ will not stand.<br>
<br>
Second, as we enter a walk of faith with God, He allows each of<br>
us to experience trials, testings, miracles, and challenges in<br>
life that are designed to provide &quot;faith experiences&quot; that<br>
demonstrate tangible evidences of His work in our life: Moses'<br>
burning-bush experience, Peter's walk on the water, Joshua's<br>
parting of the Jordan River. These experiences built the faith of<br>
these people. The depth and width of our calling is directly<br>
proportional to the faith experiences He allows in each of our<br>
lives. If God plans an international ministry with you, chances<br>
are you will experience a higher degree of faith experiences<br>
compared to another. The reason is, you will need to look on<br>
these to ensure your calling and provide testimony to His work in<br>
your life.<br>
<br>
The third stage deals with motives. &quot;All a man's ways seem<br>
innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the Lord&quot; (Prov.<br>
16:2). What is the motive behind my actions? Is it only financial<br>
accumulation? Is it to gain control? Is it to create<br>
independence? The primary motive must be God's leading you to<br>
take such an action-it must be obedience. These other factors<br>
must be by-products of the decision.<br>
<br>
Finally, we are prepared to take action. Here we must ask, &quot;Do we<br>
have the skill, quality, and ability to enter into this<br>
activity?&quot; So often we have not trained ourselves adequately to<br>
be successful in our endeavor. You would never want someone<br>
working on your teeth who had not been trained and certified as a<br>
dentist.<br>
<br>
Before you begin your next project, ask yourself these four<br>
questions. What is the foundation this project is based on? What<br>
experiences has God demonstrated in my life that indicate His<br>
involvement? What is my motive for entering this activity? Do I<br>
have the skill, quality, and ability to accomplish the task?<br>
Answering these questions will tell you whether God will bless<br>
your activity.<br>

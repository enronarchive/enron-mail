The Purpose of Crucibles<br>
<br>
The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord<br>
tests the heart.<br>
- (Proverbs 17:3)<br>
<br>
<br>
This proverb describes one of God's strangest mysteries. It is a<br>
description of God's formula to refine the human heart in order<br>
to bring out its finest qualities. The significant leaders who<br>
make the greatest mark for the Kingdom had to experience their<br>
own crucible and fire. Without it, the dross can never be removed<br>
from the human heart. Without it, the encumbrances weigh us down.<br>
God understands the human heart. He understands that for us to<br>
become all that He hopes for us, there are seasons of fire.<br>
Joseph went through many tests. Succeeding in the test qualified<br>
him for greater responsibility. The greater the use in the<br>
Kingdom the greater the crucible to prepare the right foundation.<br>
Some of God's greatest crucibles are found in the marketplace<br>
where we live every day: the employee who betrays our trust, the<br>
client who refuses to pay, the vendor who falls short of our<br>
expectations.<br>
<br>
Each of these is God's tests to find out how we will respond.<br>
What tests are being brought your way today? His grace has been<br>
provided that we might pass the tests that He brings before us.<br>
Should we fail, we need not fear. His grace is sufficient for<br>
this as well. Ask God for the grace to walk with Him in whatever<br>
tests He has placed before you this day. He is able to accomplish<br>
what He wants for you.<br>

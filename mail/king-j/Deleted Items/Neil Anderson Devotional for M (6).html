A HIGHER PRIORITY<br>
<br>
For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of<br>
God (Romans 8:14).<br>
<br>
Two significant events in my life brought into clear focus the<br>
priority of relationship over achievement. Before being called<br>
into the ministry, I worked as an aerospace engineer on the<br>
Apollo program. I will never forget the day the lunar lander<br>
touched down on the moon. This bold headline dominated the front<br>
page of the Minneapolis Star: &quot;Neil Armstrong Lands on the Moon.&quot;<br>
It was an achievement I was proud to be part of.<br>
<br>
But the really big news came months earlier on page 7 in the<br>
third section: &quot;Heidi Jo Anderson, born to Mr. and Mrs. Neil<br>
Anderson, Northwestern Hospital, March 12, 1969.&quot; That may not<br>
sound like big news to you, but it was to her mother and me.<br>
Heidi totally took over my den and captured an entire shelf in<br>
the refrigerator. She altered our sleeping pattern and restricted<br>
our social calendar. But she was ours to hold, to hug and to care<br>
for.<br>
<br>
What does God care about moon shots? They are deeds to be<br>
outdone. Somebody will always come along and do it better, faster<br>
and higher. What God cares about is little people like Heidi Jo<br>
Anderson because they will be with Him forever.<br>
<br>
The second significant event in my life was receiving my first<br>
doctoral degree. But it turned out to be one of the most<br>
anticlimactic days of my life. I heard no applause from heaven,<br>
and I don't believe my achievement added so much as an asterisk<br>
to my name in the Lamb's Book of Life. I was a child of God<br>
before that day and I was still a child of God afterward.<br>
<br>
But what happens in heaven when one sinner repents? Applause!<br>
Why? Because a relationship with God is eternal, while earthly<br>
achievements last only for time. Have you sacrificed the eternal<br>
to gain the temporal? Have you ignored personal and spiritual<br>
relationships in your pursuit of human achievements?<br>
Relationships must always have a higher priority than temporal<br>
achievements.<br>
<br>
Lord, amidst the busyness of my schedule and clutter of my<br>
possessions, help me cherish and nurture my relationships today.<br>

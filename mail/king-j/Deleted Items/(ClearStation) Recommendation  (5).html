	 Tue Oct 23 07:55:23 2001   got the move down.  eyeball the 66 dollar level which is shaping as support.  similar to GDW, short weakness below 66 or strength that results in a stochastic overbought condition.   recommended MTB Short on Oct 1 2001 when it was trading at 73 3/4. Since then it's gone down 8.20% to 67 1/2.   kensey  	<br>

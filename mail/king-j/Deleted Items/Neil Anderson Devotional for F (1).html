<br>
EVALUATING YOUR PAST<br>
<br>
It was for freedom that Christ set us free (Galatians 5:1).<br>
<br>
How does God intend for you to resolve hurtful, controlling past<br>
experiences? In two ways which we shall consider today and<br>
tomorrow.<br>
<br>
First, you have the privilege of evaluating your past experience<br>
in the light of who you are now, as opposed to who you were then.<br>
The intensity of the primary emotion was established by how you<br>
perceived the event at the time it happened. Remember: Your<br>
emotions are a product of how you perceived the event, not the<br>
event itself. As a Christian, you are not primarily a product of<br>
your past; you are primarily the product of the work of Christ on<br>
the cross. The flesh, which represents how you processed those<br>
events according to the world and without Christ, remains. But<br>
you are able to render it inoperative.<br>
<br>
When a present event activates that primary emotion, many people<br>
believe what they feel instead of believing what is true. For<br>
example, people who have been verbally abused by their parents<br>
have a hard time believing they are unconditionally loved by<br>
Father God. Their primary emotions argue that they are unlovable<br>
to a parent figure. They believe what they feel and their walk is<br>
off course. Believing the truth and walking by faith is what sets<br>
us free.<br>
<br>
Now that you are in Christ, you can look at those events from the<br>
perspective of who you are today. Christ is in your life right<br>
now desiring to set you free from your past. That is the gospel,<br>
the good news that Christ has come to set the captives free.<br>
Perceiving those events from the perspective of your new identity<br>
in Christ is what starts the process of healing those damaged<br>
emotions.<br>
<br>
God's good news about our identity is revealed in 2 Corinthians<br>
5:17: &quot;Therefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature;<br>
the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.&quot; This<br>
is what you must believe first in order to be set free from your<br>
past.<br>
<br>
Loving Lord, thank You for making me a new creation in Christ.<br>
Help me walk away from anything in my past that is restricting my<br>
freedom.<br>

SPIRITUALLY ALIVE<br>
<br>
And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and<br>
this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does<br>
not have the Son of God does not have life (1 John 5:11, 12 NIV).<br>
<br>
When God breathed life into Adam, he was both physically and<br>
spiritually alive. Adam was spiritually alive because his soul<br>
was in union with God. We were never designed to be separated<br>
from God or to live independently of Him. We were born to be<br>
spiritually alive.<br>
<br>
For the Christian, to be spiritually alive is to be in union with<br>
God. This concept is repeatedly presented in Scripture by the<br>
prepositional phrase in Christ. Being in Christ is the theme of<br>
the New Testament. Like Adam, we were created to be in union with<br>
God. But Adam sinned and his union with God, and ours as well,<br>
was severed. It is God's eternal plan to bring human creation<br>
back to Himself and restore the union He enjoyed with Adam at<br>
creation. That restored union with God, which we find in Christ,<br>
is the essence of our identity.<br>
<br>
When you were born again, your soul was united with God and you<br>
came alive spiritually, as alive as Adam was in the garden before<br>
he sinned. As the New Testament repeatedly declares, you are now<br>
in Christ, and Christ is in you. Since Christ who is in you is<br>
eternal, the spiritual life you have received from Him is<br>
eternal. You don't have to wait until you die to get eternal<br>
life; you possess it right now!<br>
<br>
The apostle John wrote, &quot;He who has the Son has the life&quot; (1 John<br>
5:12). He probably remembered Jesus' statement to Martha: &quot;I am<br>
the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me shall live<br>
even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes in Me shall<br>
never die&quot; (John 11:25, 26). After Jesus said this to Martha, He<br>
added, &quot;Do you believe this?&quot; (verse 26).<br>
<br>
The Word of God is clear: Because of Jesus, we will continue to<br>
live spiritually even after we die physically. Do you believe<br>
this?<br>
<br>
Dear Father, I declare my wholehearted belief that my spiritual<br>
life--eternal life--is in You. Help me live today with eternity's<br>
values in view.<br>

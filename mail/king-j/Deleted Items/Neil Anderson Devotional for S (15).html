SALVATION IS REGENERATION<br>
<br>
He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, in<br>
order that by them you might become partakers of the divine<br>
nature (2 Peter 1:4).<br>
<br>
What does the Bible specifically say about our nature? The Greek<br>
word for nature is used in this way only twice in the New<br>
Testament. Ephesians 2:1-3 described the nature we all shared<br>
before we came to Christ: &quot;And you were dead in your trespasses<br>
and sins . . . and were by nature children of wrath.&quot; What was<br>
your basic nature before you were born again spiritually? You and<br>
every other Christian &quot;were by nature children of wrath,&quot; dead in<br>
sin, subject to Satan's power, living completely to fulfill<br>
sinful lusts and desires. This is the condition of every<br>
unbeliever today.<br>
<br>
The second occurrence of the word is in 2 Peter 1:4 describing<br>
our nature after we came to Christ: &quot;He has granted to us His<br>
precious and magnificent promises, in order that by them you<br>
might become partakers of the divine nature.&quot;<br>
<br>
When you came into spiritual union with God through your new<br>
birth, you didn't add a new, divine nature to your old, sinful<br>
nature. You exchanged natures. Salvation isn't just a matter of<br>
God forgiving your sins and issuing you a pass to heaven when you<br>
die. Salvation is regeneration. God changed you from darkness to<br>
light, from sinner to saint. There is a newness about you that<br>
wasn't there before. If God hadn't changed your identity at<br>
salvation, you would be stuck with your old identity until you<br>
died. How could you expect to grow to maturity if you didn't<br>
start as a transformed child of God? Becoming a partaker of God's<br>
nature is fundamental to a Christian's identity and maturity.<br>
<br>
We are no longer in Adam; we are in Christ. We can still choose<br>
to walk according to the flesh, but why should we want to? &quot;You<br>
are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of<br>
God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of<br>
Christ, he does not belong to Him&quot; (Romans 8:9).<br>
<br>
Lord, may my understanding of who I am in Christ grow today so<br>
that I may walk in the victorious life You secured for me.<br>

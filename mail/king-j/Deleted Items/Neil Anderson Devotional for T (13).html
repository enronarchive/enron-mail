HOW WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES<br>
<br>
The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are<br>
children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and<br>
fellow heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16, 17).<br>
<br>
Lydia is a middle-aged woman who was dealt a bad hand in life<br>
right from the beginning. Memories of ritual and sexual abuse<br>
that she suffered as a young child have haunted her continually<br>
throughout her Christian life. When she came to see me, her<br>
damaged self-image seemed beyond repair. As she told me her<br>
story, Lydia displayed little emotion, but her words reflected<br>
total despair.<br>
<br>
When she concluded, I asked, &quot;Who are you, Lydia? How do you<br>
perceive yourself?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm evil,&quot; she answered stoically. &quot;I'm just no good for<br>
anybody. People tell me I'm evil and all I do is bring trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're not evil,&quot; I argued. &quot;How can a child of God be evil? Is<br>
that how you perceive yourself?&quot; Lydia nodded.<br>
<br>
It is never pleasant to see the evil one express his ugly<br>
personality through a victim like Lydia. But realizing that she<br>
is primarily the product of the work of Christ on the cross<br>
instead of the victim of her past, she was able to throw off the<br>
chains of spiritual bondage and begin living according to her<br>
true identity as a child of God.<br>
<br>
Nothing is more foundational to your freedom from Satan's bondage<br>
than understanding and affirming what God has done for you in<br>
Christ and who you are as a result. We all live in accordance<br>
with our perceived identity. In fact, we cannot consistently<br>
behave in a way that is inconsistent with how we perceive<br>
ourselves. Your attitudes, actions, responses and reactions to<br>
life's circumstances are often determined by your conscious and<br>
subconscious self-perception. If you see yourself as the helpless<br>
victim of Satan and his schemes, you will live like his victim<br>
and be in bondage to his lies. But if you see yourself as the<br>
dearly loved and accepted child of God that you really are, you<br>
will more likely live like a child of God.<br>
<br>
Thank You, Jesus, that You have made me more than a conqueror.<br>
Because of Your love and power, I can live as a victor instead of<br>
a victim today.<br>

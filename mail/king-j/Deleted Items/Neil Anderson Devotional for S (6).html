THE BELT OF TRUTH<br>
<br>
Having girded your loins with truth (Ephesians 6:14).<br>
<br>
The first piece of armor for the Christian warrior is the belt of<br>
truth. Jesus said, &quot;I am . . . the truth&quot; (John 14:6). And<br>
because Christ is in you, the truth is in you. However,<br>
continuing to choose truth is not always easy. Since Satan's<br>
primary weapon is the lie, your belt of truth (which holds the<br>
other pieces of body armor in place) is continually being<br>
attacked. If he can disable you in the area of truth, you become<br>
as easy target for his other attacks.<br>
<br>
You stand firm in the truth by relating everything you do to the<br>
truth of God's Word. If a thought comes to mind which is not in<br>
harmony with God's truth, dismiss it. If an opportunity comes<br>
along to say or do something which compromises or conflicts with<br>
truth, avoid it. Adopt a simple rule of behavior: If it's the<br>
truth, I'm in; if it's not the truth, count me out.<br>
<br>
When you learn to live in the truth on a daily basis, you will<br>
grow to love the truth because you have nothing to hide. You<br>
never have to cover up to God or anyone else; everything you do<br>
is in the light. Furthermore, when you live in the truth you<br>
dislodge the lies of Satan, the father of lies (John 8:44).<br>
Remember that if Satan can deceive you into believing a lie, he<br>
can control your life.<br>
<br>
Jesus prayed, &quot;I do not ask Thee to take them out of the world,<br>
but to keep them from the evil one&quot; (John 17:15). How? &quot;Sanctify<br>
them in the truth; Thy Word is truth&quot; (verse 17). You will only<br>
dislodge Satan's lies in the light of God's revelation, and not<br>
by human reasoning or research.<br>
<br>
The only thing a Christian ever has to admit to is the truth.<br>
Walking in the light and speaking the truth in love may seem<br>
threatening to some. But in reality truth is a liberating friend<br>
and the only path to fellowship with God.<br>
<br>
Forgive me, Lord, for entertaining lies and walking in darkness.<br>
Give me courage to face the truth and to speak the truth in love.<br>

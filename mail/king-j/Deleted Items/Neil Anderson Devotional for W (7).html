THE ESSENCE OF TEMPTATION<br>
<br>
For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our<br>
weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are,<br>
yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15).<br>
<br>
I have found that many Christians struggle with the distinction<br>
between temptation and sin. Bombarded by tempting thoughts, they<br>
conclude that there must be something pretty sick about them. But<br>
even Jesus was &quot;tempted in all things as we are.&quot; But finish the<br>
verse: &quot;Yet without sin.&quot; As long as we are in the world, we are<br>
exposed to temptation just like Jesus was. But He didn't sin, and<br>
we don't have to sin either (1 Corinthians 10:13).<br>
<br>
The basis for temptation is legitimate human needs. We will<br>
either look to the world, the flesh and the devil to have our<br>
needs met, or we will look to Christ who promises to meet our<br>
needs (Philippians 4:19). The essence of temptation is the<br>
invitation to live independently of God.<br>
<br>
The power of temptation depends on the strength of the<br>
strongholds which have been developed in our minds as we learned<br>
to live independently of God. If you were raised in a Christian<br>
home where magazines and television programs of questionable<br>
moral value were not allowed, the power of sexual temptation in<br>
your life will not be as great as for someone who grew up exposed<br>
to pornographic materials. Why? Because your legitimate need to<br>
be loved and accepted was met by parents who also protected you<br>
from exposure to illegitimate means of meeting your needs. The<br>
person who grew up in an environment of immorality may experience<br>
a greater struggle with sexual temptation simply because that<br>
stronghold in the mind was well-established before he was born<br>
again.<br>
<br>
Jesus was tempted to meet His own physical needs by using His<br>
divine attributes independently of the Father to turn a rock into<br>
bread. But instead He responded, &quot;Man shall not live on bread<br>
alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God&quot;<br>
(Matthew 4:4). We also must respond to temptation by relying on<br>
God to meet our needs.<br>
<br>
Dear Jesus, help me not to listen to the voice of the tempter<br>
today but to run to You as the source for meeting all my needs.<br>

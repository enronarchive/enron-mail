<br>
YOUR POSITION IN CHRIST<br>
<br>
Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from<br>
you (James 4:7).<br>
<br>
Daisy was one of the first persons I dealt with who was caught in<br>
spiritual conflicts and suffered from demonic influences. She was<br>
a Christian and a university graduate, but she had severe mental<br>
and emotional problems which developed after her father divorced<br>
her mother. Within a period of five years, Daisy had been<br>
institutionalized three times as a paranoid schizophrenic. After<br>
about three weeks of counseling with me, Daisy finally found the<br>
nerve to bring up the nighttime visitation of snakes.<br>
<br>
&quot;What about the snakes?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;They crawl on me at night when I'm in bed,&quot; she confessed.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you do when the snakes come?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I run in to my mother. But they always come back when I'm<br>
alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why don't you try something different,&quot; I continued. &quot;When<br>
you're in bed and the snakes come, say out loud, 'In the name of<br>
Christ, I command you to leave me.'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I couldn't do that,&quot; Daisy protested. &quot;I'm not mature enough or<br>
strong enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not a matter of your maturity; it's a matter of your<br>
position in Christ. You have as much right to resist Satan as I<br>
do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daisy squirmed at the prospect. &quot;Well, I guess I could do that.&quot;<br>
Daisy sighed, sounding like she had just agreed to take castor<br>
oil.<br>
<br>
The next week when Daisy walked in she said, &quot;The snakes are<br>
gone!&quot; If her problem had been strictly a neurological or<br>
chemical imbalance, taking authority over the snakes in Jesus'<br>
name wouldn't have worked. But in Daisy's case, the problem was<br>
spiritual.<br>
<br>
James wrote: &quot;Resist the devil and he will flee from you&quot; (James<br>
4:7). But if you don't resist him, he doesn't have to go. Or if<br>
you just pull the covers over your head in fear and say, &quot;O God,<br>
do something about these demonic influences,&quot; the evil spirits<br>
don't have to leave. Resisting the devil is your responsibility<br>
based on the authority you possess in Christ.<br>
<br>
Dear Father, thank You for providing me with such wonderful<br>
power. Help me not to be afraid to use it for my sake and others.<br>

The Famine That Leads to Freedom<br>
<br>
Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not<br>
die.<br>
- (Genesis 42:2)<br>
<br>
<br>
F. B. Meyer in his book, The Life of Joseph, describes a time in<br>
the life of the 12 sons of Jacob in which they were driven from<br>
their lives of self-satisfaction to an unlikely place to save<br>
their lives. Many years earlier they had thrown their youngest<br>
brother into a pit, then sold him into slavery. Thirteen years<br>
later he became the second most powerful person in Egypt. Now the<br>
world was experiencing a famine, and Joseph controlled all the<br>
stored grain of Egypt.<br>
<br>
As long as the hills were green and the pastures clothed with<br>
flocks, as long as the valleys were covered over with corn and<br>
rang with the songs of reapers, Reuben, Simeon, and the rest of<br>
them would have been unconcerned and content. But when the mighty<br>
famine came, the hearts of these men were opened to conviction.<br>
Their carnal security was shattered. They were being prepared for<br>
certain spiritual experiences they would never have dreamed. And<br>
they were being prepared for the meeting with Joseph. This is how<br>
God deals with us; He breaks up our nest, He loosens our roots,<br>
He sends a mighty famine that cuts away the whole staff of bread.<br>
Then, at such times, weary, worn, and sad, we are prepared to<br>
confess our sins and receive the words of Christ when He says,<br>
&quot;Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give<br>
you rest&quot; (Mt. 11:28).<br>
<br>
A missionary once said, &quot;There is a place where we will all be<br>
obedient.&quot; Joseph was a type of Christ in the Old Testament. The<br>
famine was an event designed to bring the brothers to repentance<br>
and a saving knowledge, physically and spiritually. It created<br>
the circumstances that led to freedom for these men. For they had<br>
been in bondage to a wicked crime against their brother for many<br>
years. It was the forgiveness from Joseph that led to that<br>
freedom.<br>
<br>
Is your life passing through a time of famine? Are your supplies<br>
limited? Is God leading you into directions that you would not<br>
normally seek? Perhaps this is God's hand creating circumstances<br>
for His purposes. Now is the time to look attentively as He<br>
directs you to unlikely sources.<br>

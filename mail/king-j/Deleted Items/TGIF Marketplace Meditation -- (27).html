Our Labor in the Lord<br>
<br>
Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you.<br>
Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you<br>
know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.<br>
- (1 Corinthians 15:58)<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a paradigm shift going on among a remnant of<br>
businesspeople today. That paradigm shift is a focus on using our<br>
business and work life as a platform for ministry versus a<br>
platform solely for material success. There is a remnant of<br>
businesspeople throughout the world today who understand their<br>
birthright in the marketplace is to reflect Christ fully in and<br>
through their work. It is reflected by a commitment to use their<br>
resources and skills to provide a product of excellence with the<br>
overall motive to affect people for Jesus Christ. The difference<br>
is that these individuals have an overriding ministry objective<br>
to their work.<br>
<br>
When the apostle Paul tells us to fully work unto the Lord, he<br>
does not mean we must be working as missionaries in &quot;full-time<br>
Christian effort.&quot; He understands that all of life is holy and<br>
sacred to God. If our motive is to serve God where we are, then<br>
our labor &quot;in the Lord is not in vain.&quot;<br>
<br>
As you begin your work today, ask God if you are working with the<br>
primary motive of reflecting His life and character through your<br>
work on this day. Let nothing move you from this motive being<br>
central to your activity. The Lord will reflect His power and<br>
leading in and through your life when this becomes your primary<br>
motive.<br>

THE LAWS OF GOD<br>
<br>
Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the<br>
platter; but inside of you, you are full of robbery and<br>
wickedness (Luke 11:39).<br>
<br>
The Talmud, a collection of ancient rabbinic writings, relates<br>
the story of Rabbi Akiba, who was imprisoned. Rabbi Joshua<br>
brought him some water, but the guard spilled half of the<br>
container. There was too little water to both wash and drink, and<br>
Rabbi Akiba faced the possibility of death for lack of water if<br>
he chose to use the water for ceremonial washing. He reasoned,<br>
&quot;He who eats with unwashed hands perpetuates a crime that ought<br>
to be punished by death. Better for me to die of thirst than to<br>
transgress the traditions of my ancestors!&quot;<br>
<br>
Jesus responded harshly to such reasoning: &quot;You blind guides, who<br>
strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!&quot; (Matthew 23:24). The Lord<br>
cautions that the weightier matters of the law (such as justice<br>
and mercy) are overlooked when attention focuses on strict<br>
observances of religious practices. This leads to a corresponding<br>
negligence of the eternal laws of God. Jesus told people to pay<br>
more attention to cleansing their hearts and not be like their<br>
leaders who cleanse only their hands.<br>
<br>
The laws of God are liberating and protective. They are<br>
restrictive only when they protect us from the evil one. The<br>
rules of any institution should ensure the freedom of each<br>
individual to reach his or her God-given potential. They should<br>
serve as a guide so we don't stray from our purpose, and they<br>
should protect us from those who abuse the system.<br>
<br>
The principle that Jesus modeled could be stated as follows: If<br>
people are commanded to follow a traditional practice that makes<br>
life more difficult and no longer contributes to the purpose of<br>
the organization, then we must not participate as a matter of<br>
religious conscience. Jesus simply didn't observe such<br>
traditions, and He defended His disciples for not observing them<br>
as well.<br>
<br>
Thank You for reminding me, Lord, that the law kills but the<br>
Spirit gives life. Help me walk in that freedom today.<br>

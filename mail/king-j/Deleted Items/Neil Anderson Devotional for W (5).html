DEALING WITH THE DARK WORLD<br>
<br>
The Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall<br>
away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and<br>
doctrines of demons (1 Timothy 4:1).<br>
<br>
A few years ago I was speaking in a Southern California church on<br>
the subject of the New Age Movement. My text was 1 Timothy 4:1.<br>
After my message, I was surrounded at the front of the sanctuary<br>
by people wanting to hear more about freedom from spiritual<br>
conflicts caused by demonic influences.<br>
<br>
Sitting about halfway back in the sanctuary was a 22-year-old<br>
woman who had been weeping uncontrollably since the service<br>
ended. As I approached the young woman, I could hear her sobbing,<br>
&quot;He understands! He understands!&quot;<br>
<br>
later Nancy described to me her horrible childhood, which<br>
included an abusive father and a grandmother who identified<br>
herself as a black witch. &quot;When I was three years old, I received<br>
my guardians--spirit guides,&quot; she continued. &quot;They were my<br>
companions, telling me how to live and what to say. I never<br>
questioned if having spirit guides was anything but normal until<br>
my mother took me to Sunday school.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you like to get rid of your spirit guides?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
There was a long pause. &quot;Will they really leave, or will I go<br>
home and be thrashed by them again?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You will be free,&quot; I assured her. An hour later Nancy was free.<br>
<br>
Nancy's experience is not an obscure, erratic blip in the<br>
contemporary Christian community. In face, in more than 20 years<br>
of ministry as a pastor, counselor, seminary professor and<br>
conference speaker, I have met and ministered to more Christians<br>
in bondage to the dark side of the spiritual world than you may<br>
believe. Christians are woefully unprepared to deal with the dark<br>
world of Satan's kingdom or to minister to those who are in<br>
bondage to it.<br>
<br>
Yes, as Timothy warned, &quot;deceitful spirits and doctrines of<br>
demons&quot; are real. But as you daily embrace Christ and His truth,<br>
you will be able to recognize Satan's lies and choose the truth.<br>
<br>
Thank You, Jesus, for being the way, the truth, and the life. I<br>
know You are my weapon for overcoming the evil one.<br>

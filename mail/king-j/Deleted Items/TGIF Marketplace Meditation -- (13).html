A Man Who Has God's Favor<br>
<br>
&quot;...Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with<br>
you.&quot;<br>
- (Zechariah 8:23)<br>
<br>
<br>
Few men of God have become extraordinary people of faith without<br>
the influence of mentors. A mentor is one who takes<br>
responsibility for the spiritual and, sometimes, physical care of<br>
another. It requires a commitment from the teacher and the<br>
student.<br>
<br>
Elijah mentored Elisha. Elisha became one of the greatest<br>
prophets in all the Bible. One of the primary reasons for this<br>
was Elisha's hunger. Elisha wanted a double portion of Elijah's<br>
spirit. It was this hunger that drove Elisha to be sold out to<br>
God's purposes for his life.<br>
<br>
I have been privileged to have had many mentors throughout my<br>
spiritual life. In each stage of my maturity, God brought new<br>
mentors who had unique gifts that the previous mentor did not<br>
have. God has given me the hunger to desire a double portion of<br>
those positive attributes of my mentors. This desire is sorely<br>
missing among many today. I fail to see the hunger among many who<br>
could be used greatly in the Kingdom. Instead, they get<br>
distracted by the cares of this world. It is an attitude of a la<br>
carte versus an attitude of pressing in to the full measure of<br>
what God might have for them.<br>
<br>
Who are the people of God He has placed in your life? Are you<br>
learning from them? Are you seeking a double portion of their<br>
anointing? What prevents you from gaining from their wisdom and<br>
experience? God may have brought them into your life to prepare<br>
you to be a man or woman of God with great anointing. However,<br>
there is a time of training and waiting to prove out your own<br>
faith. Ask God today if there is someone He would have you mentor<br>
or be mentored by.<br>

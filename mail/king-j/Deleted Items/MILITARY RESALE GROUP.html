MRG TRIPLES WAREHOUSE SPACE IN ANTICIPATION OF CONTINUED<br>
RAPID GROWTH<br>
<br>
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.--Oct. 16, 2001--Military Resale<br>
Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL) is pleased to announce it has<br>
moved from its previous 12,000-square-foot warehouse to one<br>
containing almost 33,000 square feet.<br>
<br>
This move will allow the Company to approximately triple<br>
its dry space, double its cooler space and triple its<br>
freezer space. Ethan D. Hokit, President, stated that<br>
``many household name companies have requested that we<br>
begin to service their accounts in our current market.<br>
Consequently, we continue our planned multiphase expansion<br>
to serve the Military Resale Market. Military Resale Group,<br>
Inc. is negotiating with several companies to obtain new<br>
business and anticipates showing continued growth in sales,<br>
which the new warehouse would accommodate.''<br>
<br>
In 1999, Military Resale Group, Inc. was housed in a 2,500-<br>
square-foot warehouse and a few months later acquired<br>
another 2,000 square feet. In October 1999, the Company<br>
acquired another 7,500 square feet, bringing its total to<br>
12,000 square feet. This space was adequate until a few<br>
months ago, when it became evident that more warehouse<br>
space was needed to support the growth that the Company is<br>
experiencing.<br>
<br>
Military Resale Group, Inc. (MRG) was incorporated in 1997<br>
when it acquired a 50-year-old distributor to the Military<br>
Resale Market. At that time MRG's annual sales were<br>
$750,000, and they have since soared five-fold in three<br>
years to $4.5 million in 2000. Military Resale Group is now<br>
a publicly owned company as a result of its recent<br>
acquisition by Bactrol Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB: BCTL).<br>
<br>
The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market,<br>
with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under<br>
the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a<br>
Department of Defense agency. The DOD's objective, in this<br>
area, is to operate resale store systems, which sell<br>
groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise (at<br>
exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices. The<br>
resulting average cost savings of about 25% are a major<br>
fringe benefit (untaxed) to military personnel. The<br>
competitive structure of the Military Resale Market<br>
consists of a few large distributors, who do not dominate<br>
the industry, and hundreds of small ones. The post-<br>
acquisition strategy of MRG is to grow, primarily, by<br>
acquiring other small distributors and, secondarily, by<br>
internal growth.<br>

Readers are cautioned that small and micro-cap stocks are<br>
high-risk investments and that they may lose all or a<br>
portion of their investment if they make a purchase in our<br>
advertised stocks. In order to be in full compliance with<br>
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(b), we have<br>
received a total of 30,000 free trading shares of Bactrol<br>
Technologies, Inc. from Xcel Associates, Inc. as<br>
compensation for the distribution of this and other<br>
advertisements. Since we have received compensation and<br>
hold stock in the advertised company there is an inherent<br>
conflict of interest in our statements and opinions and<br>
such statements and opinions cannot be considered<br>
independent. We will benefit from any increase in share<br>
price of the advertised company. We will sell our shares at<br>
any time, without notice, be that before, during or<br>
immediately after the release of this advertisement. The<br>
liquidation of our stock may have a negative impact on the<br>
securities of the company liquidated, including decreased<br>
market value and/or dilution of the company's securities.<br>
Furthermore, our associates and/or employees and/or<br>
principals may have stock positions in advertised companies<br>
purchased in the open market or in private transactions.<br>

notification, even after we have made positive comments<br>
regarding the advertised company. It should be understood<br>

solely opinions and should not be taken as suggested<br>
holding periods. In fact, we will sell our positions in any<br>

The stocks of advertised companies may trade in fast<br>
moving, highly volatile markets, and any reader should<br>
observe the trading behavior of any advertised company<br>
prior to investing. Advertised stocks are often thinly<br>
traded and large sell orders will have a substantially<br>
negative impact on share price. Investors in advertised<br>
stocks may experience difficulty in selling shares without<br>
seeing a decline in market price and may have difficulty in<br>
finding ready buyers of their stock. Information within<br>
this advertisement contains &quot;forward looking&quot; statements<br>
within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the U.S. Securities<br>
Act of 1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities<br>
Exchange Act of 1934. Any statements that express or<br>
involve discussions with respect to predictions,<br>
expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives,<br>
goals, assumptions or future events or performance are not<br>
statements of historical facts and may be forward looking<br>
statements. Forward looking statements are based on<br>
expectations, estimates and projections at the time the<br>
statements are made that involve a number of risks and<br>
uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to<br>
differ materially from those presently anticipated. Forward<br>
looking statements may be identified through the use of<br>
words such as expects, will, anticipates, estimates,<br>
believes, or by statements indicating certain actions may,<br>
could or might occur. We encourage our readers to invest<br>

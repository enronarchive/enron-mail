Weapons of Warfare<br>
<br>
Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into<br>
spears.<br>
- (Joel 3:10)<br>
<br>
<br>
In this third chapter of Joel, we hear the prophet describe a<br>
time yet to come. It will be a time of great harvest on the<br>
earth, and this verse describes the catalyst. A plowshare is an<br>
agricultural instrument used to till the soil. At this point in<br>
history, it was a tool that spoke of one's vocation. However, the<br>
prophet was speaking of a time yet to come. The prophet described<br>
the plowshare as an instrument that will be turned into a sword.<br>
The sword is often used in the Bible to describe God's Word. The<br>
only way a plowshare can be turned into a sword is for it to go<br>
through extreme heat, and then the blacksmith must beat that<br>
plowshare into shape. Heat and punishment of the metal turns that<br>
plowshare into an instrument of battle. God must do this in each<br>
of our lives in order for us to be useable as a worthy sword. We<br>
are all in a battle-a spiritual battle. Paul describes our battle<br>
as one against the principalities of the unseen world. I believe<br>
God is going to raise up many in the marketplace to use their<br>
plowshare as a weapon of righteousness in these last days. That<br>
weapon won't be used for destruction, but as a weapon of love.<br>
That weapon of love will yield a great harvest in our lifetime.<br>
But this is only part of the story.<br>
<br>
God is also going to turn our pruning hooks into spears. A<br>
pruning hook is used in two ways. First, it is used to prune a<br>
tree for greater growth and productivity. It is also used to cut<br>
the fruit from taller trees in which one cannot reach the fruit.<br>
This fruit from our vocation is going to be cast forth like a<br>
spear, but even more as seed planted to bring the harvest of<br>
which Joel speaks. Fruit from our business life is often the<br>
financial rewards generated. God wants to use our finances and<br>
everything else for His purposes. We must use our vocations and<br>
the fruit that comes from them as seed to bring the great harvest<br>
that God is planning.<br>
<br>
How are you using your plowshare and your pruning hook for God's<br>
glory today? Ask God to show you how He wants to use your skills,<br>
resources, and relationships to prepare for the great harvest He<br>
has planned.<br>

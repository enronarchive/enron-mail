Seeing a Greater Purpose in Adversity<br>
<br>
But Paul shouted,&quot;Don't harm yourself! We are all here!&quot;<br>
- (Acts 16:28)<br>
<br>
<br>
Paul and Silas had just been thrown into prison. An earthquake<br>
erupted and the jail cell was opened. It's Paul and Silas'<br>
opportunity. &quot;Deliverance! Praise God!&quot; might be the appropriate<br>
response. But this is not what Paul and Silas did. In fact,<br>
rather than leave, they sat quietly in their cell area. The<br>
guard, in fear of his life, knew that it would be automatic death<br>
if prisoners escaped. Paul and Silas did not leave because they<br>
saw a higher purpose for which they were in prison. They were not<br>
looking at their circumstance; they were much more concerned<br>
about the unsaved guard. The story goes on to explain how Paul<br>
and Silas went home with the guard and his family. Not only did<br>
the guard get saved, but his entire household as well.<br>
<br>
What a lesson this is for us. How often we are so busy looking<br>
for deliverance from our circumstance that we miss God<br>
completely. God is looking to do miracles in our circumstances if<br>
we will only look for them. Sometimes as businesspeople we become<br>
so obsessed with our goals we miss the process that God involves<br>
us in, which may be where the miracle lies. What if that bill<br>
collector who has been hounding you is unsaved and he is there<br>
for you to speak to? What if a problem account has arisen due to<br>
something God is doing beyond what you might see at this time?<br>
Our adverse situations can often be the door of spiritual<br>
opportunity for those who need it.<br>
<br>
I saw this personally when God allowed me to go through a number<br>
of adversities. It took some time, but I saw some great miracles<br>
as a result of those adversities. When God said that &quot;all things<br>
work together for good for those who are called according to His<br>
purposes&quot; (see Rom. 8:28), He meant all things. It is up to us to<br>
find the &quot;work together for good&quot; part by being faithful to the<br>
process. In the next adversity you face, tune your spiritual<br>
antennae and ask God for discernment to see the real purpose for<br>
the adversity.<br>

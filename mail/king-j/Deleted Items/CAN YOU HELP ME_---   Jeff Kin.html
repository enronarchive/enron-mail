FROM Dr OLOGURU<br>
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.<br>
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.<br>
UNION TOGOLAISE DU BANQUE<br>
LOME- TOGO.<br>
TEL:00228-911-40-37.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
DEAR,<br>
                   (CONFIDETIAL PLEASE)<br>
<br>
I am Dr OLOGURU, chief accountant for the bills and<br>
credits in the foreign remittance dept. section of<br>
Union Togolaise Du Banque Lome-Togo in west Africa<br>
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact<br>
you on a business transaction that will be very<br>
beneficial to both of us at the end of the<br>
transaction.<br>
<br>
During our investigation and auditting in this bank,<br>
my<br>
department came across a very huge sum of money<br>
belonging to a deceased person who died on november<br>
1992 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in<br>
his account with this Bank without any claim of the<br>
fund in our custody either from his family or relation<br>
before our discovery to this development.<br>
<br>
Although personally, I keep this information secret<br>
within myself and partner to enable the whole plans<br>
and idea be Profitable and successful during the time<br>
of execution. The said amount was $6,500,000.00usd(six<br>
million five hundred thousand united states dollars).<br>
<br>
As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive<br>
information through my good friends who works with<br>
chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here<br>
in Lome-Togo. It is him who recommended your person<br>
to me to be viable and capable to champion a business<br>
of such magnitude without any problem .<br>
<br>
Meanwhile all the whole arrangements to put claim over<br>
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,<br>
get the required approval and transfer this money to a<br>
foreign account has been put in place and directives<br>
and needed information will be relayed to you as soon<br>
as you indicate your interest and willingness to<br>
assist us and also benefit your self to this great<br>
business opportunity.<br>
<br>
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because<br>
of my position in this country as a civil servant, we<br>
are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would<br>
eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the<br>
time<br>
of transfer because I work in this bank.<br>
<br>
This is the actual reason why it will require a second<br>
party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of<br>
kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and<br>
also present a foreign account where he will need the<br>
money to be re-transferred into, on his request as it<br>
may be after due verification and clarification by the<br>
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money<br>
will be remitted from to your own designation bank<br>
account.<br>
<br>
I will not fail to inform you that this transaction<br>
is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this<br>
transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total<br>
sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to<br>
take care of expenses that may arise during the time<br>
of transfer and also telephone and fax bills, while<br>
60% will be for me and my partner.<br>
<br>
Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as<br>
we are still in service and intend to retire from<br>
service after we conclude this deal with you. I will<br>
be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank<br>
until you confirm the money in your account. and ask<br>
us<br>
to come down to your country for subsequent sharing<br>
of the fund according to percentage.<br>
<br>
previously indicated and further investment, either in<br>
your country or any country you advice us to invest<br>
in. All other necessary information will be sent to<br>
you<br>
when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as<br>
soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal.<br>
<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
Dr.OLOGURU<br>

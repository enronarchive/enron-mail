Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
We wanted to briefly let you know about some new newsletters from<br>
Crosswalk.com that you may not want to miss:<br>
<br>
 * INSIGHTS from Bill Bright<br>
Beginning in mid-February, Dr. Bill Bright will be sharing his heart in<br>
this daily email.  You will be encouraged and inspired by his<br>
reflections on a lifetime of ministry.  Dr. Bright, founder and chairman<br>
of Campus Crusade for Christ, says, &quot;In my remaining time on this earth,<br>
I want to communicate certain precious truths I have learned to as many<br>
people as possible.&quot;  Don't miss this opportunity to sit at his feet.<br>

 * The Single Truth<br>
Lori Smith's articles offer a fresh perspective on singleness.  If you<br>
feel like you don't fit in at church, if you're tired of meat markets<br>
and set-ups, or wonder what God is doing with your life, this newsletter<br>
is for you.  Lori says, &quot;I think many singles feel like they've missed<br>
the boat somewhere, and aren't receiving God's best for their lives.<br>
That's just not true!&quot;<br>

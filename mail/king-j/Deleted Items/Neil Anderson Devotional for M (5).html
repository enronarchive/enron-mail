CHILDREN NEED MODELS<br>
<br>
A pupil is not above his teacher; but everyone, after he has been<br>
fully trained, will be like his teacher (Luke 6:40).<br>
<br>
Your children need to see how you handle failure even more than<br>
how you handle success. If you make a mistake, you need to own up<br>
to it and ask forgiveness if the situation calls for it. If you<br>
don't model how to deal with your own fleshly responses, how are<br>
they going to learn how to own up to their mistakes and resolve<br>
them biblically?<br>
<br>
One Sunday morning my daughter wasn't ready when I wanted to<br>
leave for church. I fumed about it until I exploded with anger.<br>
After the service I was about to say grace before a meal when I<br>
felt the convicting hand of God weighing heavily upon me. I<br>
stopped and asked my family to forgive me for my outburst of<br>
anger. I didn't confess my daughter's tardiness because it wasn't<br>
my responsibility. Nor did I ask their forgiveness in hopes that<br>
my daughter would own up to her tardiness. I asked their<br>
forgiveness because my outburst of anger was a deed of the flesh.<br>
I had to ask forgiveness to be right with God myself.<br>
<br>
You never lose esteem in your child's eyes when you do what God<br>
requires you to do. You gain esteem because you are an honest<br>
person, and in the process you are modeling what they need to do<br>
when they blow it. Children need models, not critics. Modeling is<br>
what establishes our credibility to &quot;bring them up in the<br>
discipline and instruction of the Lord&quot; (Ephesians 6:4).<br>
<br>
Lord, help me model a life of obedience and honesty before my<br>
children and others who look to me as an example. And when I<br>
fail, give me grace to admit my mistakes and resolve my<br>
conflicts.<br>

CHANGING DIRECTIONS<br>
<br>
Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are God my Savior,<br>
and my hope is in You all day long (Psalm 25:5 NIV).<br>
<br>
The next five questions to ask yourself regarding God's will are<br>
to help you when facing a change in direction.<br>
<br>
  1 Is it reasonable? God expects us to think. His guidance may<br>
    transcend human reasoning, but it never excludes it. God<br>
    doesn't bypass our mind; He operates through it: &quot;Brethren,<br>
    do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be babes,<br>
    but in your thinking be mature&quot; (1 Corinthians 14:20). We are<br>
    warned in Scripture not to put our mind in neutral. We are to<br>
    think and practice what we know to be true (Philippians 4:8,<br>
    9).<br>
<br>
  2 Does a realistic opportunity exist? Closed doors are not<br>
    meant to be knocked down. If you have a hopeless scheme, let<br>
    it go. If it isn't God's timing, wait. If a realistic<br>
    opportunity exists, and all the other factors are in<br>
    agreement, then take the plunge. God may open a window of<br>
    opportunity, but it will close if not taken advantage of. The<br>
    faithless man asks, &quot;What do I stand to lose if I do?&quot; The<br>
    faithful man asks, &quot;What do I risk losing if I don't?&quot;<br>
<br>
  3 Are unbiased, spiritually sensitive associates in agreement?<br>
    Be careful not to consult only those who will agree with you.<br>
    Give your advisors permission to ask hard questions. Don't be<br>
    afraid of &quot;no&quot; answers. If it isn't God's will, don't you<br>
    want to know before you make the mistake of acting<br>
    impulsively?<br>
<br>
  4 Do I have a sanctified desire? Don't think that being in the<br>
    will of God must always be an unpleasant task. The joy of the<br>
    Lord should be our strength. I find my greatest joy in<br>
    serving God and being in His will. But don't get the idea<br>
    that if everything is wonderful, you must be in the will of<br>
    God. Is this a desire to satisfy a lust of the flesh or a<br>
    Spirit-filled desire to see God's kingdom established and<br>
    people helped?<br>
<br>
  5 Do I have a peace about it? This is an inner peace. Is the<br>
    peace of God guarding your heart and mind?<br>
<br>
If you have been able to answer yes to all 10 of these deciding<br>
factors, what are you waiting for?<br>
<br>
Thank You, Lord, that I can trust You with the details and<br>
direction of my life today.<br>

FACING A DECISION<br>
<br>
Show me your ways, O LORD, teach me your paths (Psalm 25:4 NIV).<br>
<br>
In today's and tomorrow's devotionals, I would like to share with<br>
you 10 questions you'll want to ask yourself and pray about when<br>
you're faced with a decision. The first five are generic. They<br>
represent moral issues and godly wisdom that are normative for<br>
all times.<br>
<br>
  1 Have you prayed about it? Prayer was never intended to be a<br>
    fourth-down punting situation in which we ask God to bail us<br>
    out of our hasty decisions. It was intended to be a<br>
    first-down huddle. We aren't supposed to ask God to bless our<br>
    plans; we're supposed to ask God for His plans.<br>
<br>
  2 Is it consistent with the Word of God? In our culture,<br>
    ignorance of God's Word is no excuse since resources abound.<br>
    I believe that every home should have at least a concordance,<br>
    a Bible dictionary, a topical Bible, a good commentary, and a<br>
    study Bible with notes. Most pastors would love to share what<br>
    God has to say about a given matter. If they wouldn't, you<br>
    have called the wrong pastor!<br>
<br>
  3 Can I do it and be a positive Christian witness? A seminary<br>
    student stopped by my office and told me about a job he had<br>
    been offered. It would take care of his financial needs, but<br>
    he had some reservations concerning the sales pitch he was<br>
    required to use. I asked him if he could use the sales<br>
    technique and be a positive witness for Christ. He didn't<br>
    take the job.<br>
<br>
  4 Will the Lord be glorified? Can I do this and give glory to<br>
    God? In doing it, would I be glorifying God in my body? Am I<br>
    seeking the glory of man or the glory of God? Am I doing this<br>
    to be noticed by man or am I seeking to please the Lord?<br>
<br>
  5 Am I acting responsibly? God doesn't bail us out of our<br>
    irresponsibility. But when we are faithful in little things,<br>
    He will put us in charge of greater things. Don't get ahead<br>
    of God's timing or you will be over your head in<br>
    responsibilities. Seek to develop your life and message, and<br>
    God will expand your ministry.<br>
<br>
Dear Lord, help me take a good, hard look at these questions and<br>
then avoid at all costs any compromise with Your will in my life<br>
today.<br>

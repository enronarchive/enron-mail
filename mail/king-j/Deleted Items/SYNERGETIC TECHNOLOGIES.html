SYNERGETIC TECHNOLOGIES COMPLETES THE ACQUISITION OF CUSTOM<br>
BROADBAND INC. TO PROVIDE IN-HOUSE SUPPORT FOR ANTI-<br>
TERRORIST EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE FOR THE AIRLINE AND TRAVEL<br>
INDUSTRIES<br>
<br>
SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 28 -- Synergetic Technologies Inc.<br>
(Pink Sheets: SYGE) announced today that the company has<br>
completed the purchase of Custom Broadband Inc., a newly<br>
formed company. Custom Broadband Inc. was formed as an<br>
independent operating arm of a much larger satellite uplink<br>
and broadband broadcasting company. The purpose of the<br>
formation is to provide ICU Security Systems Inc. with<br>
continuous broadcast abilities for all land and air based<br>
transmissions of critical data and live streaming video to<br>
ground based receptors .<br>
<br>
Custom Broadband Inc. will work only for ICU Security<br>
Systems Inc. to provide clear and efficient data<br>
transmissions. The principles of Custom Broadband Inc. have<br>
several years of satellite transmission experience, and<br>
will be able to provide this service to the company.<br>
<br>
The world airline industry has approximately 12,000<br>
(information obtained from Boeing) active passenger and<br>
commercial aircraft in service at this time. The cost per<br>
aircraft is not static as each airline configures floor<br>
plans differently, and each model of aircraft will have<br>
different requirements based on divisions of floor plan,<br>
and layout of security sensitive areas. The company<br>
anticipates that on board costs for a Boeing 767 for<br>
example would be close to $5,000, and $10,000 per 747, with<br>
a cost of $20,000 per ground unit. Each ground unit will<br>
service 20 aircraft on an immediate tracking base for the<br>
local area of departing and incoming flights, and with the<br>
addition of Custom Broadband Inc. the ground unit can track<br>
a aircraft world wide if desired. The recurring revenue<br>
stream from data transition will be paid to Synergetic<br>
Technologies Inc. on a per minute bases with a 20% built in<br>
profit over and above transmission costs. These charges<br>
will be collected weekly using electronic bank<br>
transactions.<br>
<br>
The addition of Custom Broadband Inc. also allows the<br>
company to broadcast images worldwide from any moving or<br>
stationary platform. This is considered a very important<br>
part of the development path for 2 additional products that<br>
will be made available for the home and retail market using<br>
very similar technologies based on a home computer, to<br>
provide worldwide access to home and personal property<br>
surveillance using portions of the ICU Security System Inc.<br>
platform.<br>
<br>
Although it is hard to put a dollar figure on the future<br>
business of this company the future is very bright and the<br>
company looks forward to active beta tests in the very near<br>
future. Investors should be advised that these are<br>
developmental stage companies and technologies. However it<br>
is the goal of Synergetic Technologies Inc. to provide a<br>
vertical integration into this industry and be able to<br>
provide these services at very competitive rates.<br>
<br>

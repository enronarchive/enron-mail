GOD'S MINISTRY OF DARKNESS<br>
<br>
For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for<br>
Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our<br>
mortal flesh (2 Corinthians 4:11).<br>
<br>
What is the point of troubled times in our lives? What is God<br>
trying to do? What is He trying to teach us? Peter wrote,<br>
&quot;Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you,<br>
which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange<br>
thing were happening to you; but to the degree that you share the<br>
sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing; so that also at the<br>
revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exultation&quot; (1<br>
Peter 4:12, 13).<br>
<br>
In God's ministry of testing, we learn a lot about ourselves.<br>
Whatever is left of simplistic advice such as &quot;Read your Bible&quot;<br>
or &quot;Just work harder&quot; or &quot;Pray more&quot; gets stripped away. Most<br>
people going through testing times would love to resolve the<br>
crisis, but they seemingly can't and don't know why.<br>
<br>
In God's ministry of darkness we learn compassion. We learn to<br>
wait patiently with people. We learn to respond to the emotional<br>
needs of people who have lost hope. We weep with those who weep.<br>
We don't try to teach or instruct or advise. If God took away<br>
every external blessing and reduced our assets to nothing more<br>
than meaningful relationships, would that be enough to sustain<br>
us? Yes, I believe it would.<br>
<br>
Perhaps God brings us to the end of our resources so we can<br>
discover the vastness of His. We don't hear many sermons about<br>
brokenness in our churches these days, yet in all four Gospels<br>
Jesus taught us to deny ourselves, pick up our cross daily, and<br>
follow Him. I don't know any painless way to die to ourselves,<br>
but I do know that it's necessary and that it's the best possible<br>
thing that could ever happen to us.<br>
<br>
&quot;No pain, no gain,&quot; says the body builder. Isn't that true in the<br>
spiritual realm as well (Hebrews 12:11)? Proven character comes<br>
from persevering through the tribulations of life (Romans 5:3-5).<br>
Every great period of personal growth in my life and ministry has<br>
been preceded by a major time of testing.<br>
<br>
Lord, I submit to Your testing so I may come to the end of my<br>
resources and joyfully discover Yours.<br>

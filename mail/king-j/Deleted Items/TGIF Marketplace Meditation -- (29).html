When God Seems Far Away<br>
<br>
Why, O Lord, do You stand far off? Why do You hide Yourself in<br>
times of trouble?<br>
- (Psalms 10:1)<br>
<br>
<br>
One of the great mysteries of God is His ways. Some of His ways<br>
almost appear to bring us into the most difficult places, as if<br>
He were indifferent to our circumstances. It would appear that He<br>
is turning His head from our sorrows. These events in our lives<br>
have a particular objective to perform for us. That objective is<br>
to bring us to the end of ourselves that we might discover the<br>
treasure of darkness. &quot;Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when<br>
I looked for light, then came darkness&quot; (Job 30:26).<br>
<br>
When we are taken into these dark periods, we begin to see light<br>
that we never knew existed. Our sensitivities become heightened<br>
and our ability to see through spiritual eyes is illuminated.<br>
Unless we are taken into these times, our souls never develop any<br>
depth of character. We do not gain wisdom, only knowledge.<br>
Knowledge is gained through understanding; wisdom is gained<br>
through the experience of darkness.<br>
<br>
After we go through these periods, we discover that God was, in<br>
fact, with us throughout the entire time. It does not feel or<br>
appear that He is there when we are in the midst of the dark<br>
periods. However, He is there walking with us. He has told us<br>
countless times that He will never leave us. However, when we are<br>
in those dark periods, it does not feel like He is there because<br>
He does not rescue us from the circumstances. He does this for<br>
our benefit in order that we might become more like Jesus. Jesus<br>
learned obedience from the things He suffered (see Heb. 5:8).<br>
What does that say about how you and I will learn obedience?<br>
Embrace the dark times and gain the wisdom that God intends for<br>
you from these times.<br>

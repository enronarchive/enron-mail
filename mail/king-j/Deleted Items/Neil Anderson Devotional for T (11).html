RECKLESS ABANDON<br>
<br>
I do not want you to become sharers in demons (1 Corinthians<br>
10:20).<br>
<br>
While Christians have been questioning the reality of demonic<br>
influence in the church, the world has charged into the spiritual<br>
realm with reckless abandon. The Western world is experiencing a<br>
massive paradigm shift in its worldview, as best seen in the rise<br>
of the New Age Movement, the acceptance of parapsychology as a<br>
science, the growing popularity of the supernatural, and the<br>
increasing visibility of Satanism in our culture. New Age<br>
mysticism, which gathered its greatest strength with the influx<br>
of Eastern religions in the 1960s, has been popularized by a host<br>
of celebrities in the 1980s. It's commonplace to hear channelers<br>
(mediums) on radio and TV talk shows boasting about their spirit<br>
guides (demons).<br>
<br>
But the New Age Movement is not just a celebrity issue. New Age<br>
philosophy is making significant inroads into business, education<br>
and even religion across our nation. Recently I challenged two my<br>
students to attend, for the sake of research, a New Age<br>
conference being held two blocks from our school. When they<br>
arrived at the door and discovered the cost to be $65 each, they<br>
started to walk away. But two strangers approached them saying,<br>
&quot;We were told to give you these tickets.&quot; My wide-eyed students<br>
took the tickets and walked in.<br>
<br>
They reported to me that one of the speakers led conference<br>
participants in a meditation exercise. He challenged everyone to<br>
imagine a spirit guide coming alongside. The speaker concluded<br>
the exercise by saying, &quot;Now invite your spirit guide to come<br>
in.&quot; I could hardly believe it. The devil is giving altar calls<br>
just two blocks from Biola University!<br>
<br>
Does the spread of New Age and the occult worry you or frighten<br>
you? It need not. In Christ you have every resource to defuse and<br>
dispel any threat of darkness in your life or family. Stand on<br>
the truth of His Word and walk in the light of your identity in<br>
Christ.<br>
<br>
Keep me alert today, Lord, to inroads the devil is attempting in<br>
my world that I may tear down his strongholds with the weapons of<br>
the Spirit.<br>

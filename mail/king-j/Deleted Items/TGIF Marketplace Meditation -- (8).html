Placing Trust in Our Strength<br>
<br>
So the Lord sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of<br>
Israel fell dead.<br>
- (1 Chronicles 21:14)<br>
<br>
<br>
When was the last time your overconfidence cost the lives of<br>
70,000 men? That is exactly what happened to David. David made<br>
what might appear to be an innocent request of his general, Joab.<br>
But the minute Joab heard the request, he cringed. He knew David<br>
was in big trouble for this one. You see, to number the troops<br>
was a great sin in Israel because it was against the law. Why?<br>
Because it demonstrated that you were placing more trust in<br>
numbers than in the living God. David displayed enough pride to<br>
cost the lives of 70,000 fighting men. God gave him three choices<br>
of punishment for his sin. A plague was the one he chose, and it<br>
resulted in the loss of 70,000.<br>
<br>
Throughout Israel's history, God set the stage for battles to be<br>
won, miracles to take place, and people to exercise faith. The<br>
stage was always set so that man could not take credit for what<br>
God did. Consider Gideon who was only allowed 300 men to fight an<br>
army of 100,000. Consider Jehoshaphat, who had to lead his army<br>
with his singers. God defeated the enemy. Consider Joshua, who<br>
was told simply to walk around Jericho seven times, and they<br>
would get victory. God did things in some very unconventional<br>
ways!<br>
<br>
How does this relate to you and me as businesspeople? Well, the<br>
minute you and I place more trust in our abilities than in God,<br>
we are guilty of numbering the troops. How does He punish us?<br>
Sometimes it's through letting a deal go sour. Sometimes it's<br>
through problems with a client or vendor. Sometimes situations<br>
just blow up in our face. Other times, He lets us go on for a<br>
long time doing our own thing, but eventually He deals with it.<br>
<br>
The lesson here is to learn daily and complete dependence on God.<br>
Use your gifts and abilities through the power of the Holy<br>
Spirit. Ask Him daily for direction and wisdom. His ways won't<br>
always line up with conventional wisdom. When we begin depending<br>
on our abilities only, God has a responsibility to make known to<br>
us who is the giver of the blessings.<br>

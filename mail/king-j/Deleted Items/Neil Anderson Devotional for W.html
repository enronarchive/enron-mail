UNDER SPIRITUAL ATTACK<br>
<br>
The Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall<br>
away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and<br>
doctrines of demons (1 Timothy 4:1).<br>
<br>
A seminary student stopped by my office to tell me he was having<br>
difficulty getting to school on time. What should have been a<br>
five-minute drive lengthened to 45 minutes because a voice in his<br>
mind kept telling him to turn at intersections. Not wanting to<br>
disobey what he perceived to be the &quot;still, small voice of God,&quot;<br>
he was treated to a tour of the city almost every morning.<br>
<br>
A pastor's wife, desperately needing the comfort of the Holy<br>
Spirit and desiring His leading, passively believed that whatever<br>
entered her mind was from God. She soon found herself bound by<br>
fear and plagued by condemning thoughts.<br>
<br>
These examples underscore the wisdom of John Wesley's words: &quot;Do<br>
not hastily ascribe things to God. Do not easily suppose dreams,<br>
voices, impressions, visions or revelations to be from God. They<br>
may be from Him. They may be from nature. They may be from the<br>
devil. Therefore, do not believe every spirit, but try the<br>
spirits, whether they be from God&quot; (Martin Wells Knapp,<br>
Impressions, Wheaton, IL: Tyndale House Publishers, 1984, p. 32).<br>
<br>
In a survey of 1700 professing Christian teenagers, 70 percent<br>
admitted to hearing voices, like there was a subconscious self<br>
talking to them. I don't believe they are psychotic or paranoid<br>
schizophrenic. There is a battle going on for their minds. I have<br>
shared with many tormented people that they aren't going crazy<br>
but are under spiritual attack. They usually respond, &quot;Praise the<br>
Lord, someone understands.&quot; It's freeing to know this truth,<br>
because if there is a battle going on for our minds, we can win<br>
that war.<br>
<br>
Lord, today I choose to test the spirits and assume my<br>
responsibility to think upon that which is true.<br>

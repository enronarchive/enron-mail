SIGNS AND WONDERS<br>
<br>
By this all men will know that you are My disciples if you have<br>
love for one another (John 13:35).<br>
<br>
Signs and wonders validated the ministry of Jesus and the<br>
apostles. After quoting from the prophet Joel and demonstrating<br>
that the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost was biblical,<br>
Peter preached about Jesus of Nazareth as &quot;a man attested to you<br>
by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed<br>
through Him in your midst&quot; (Acts 2:22). Of the apostles, Paul<br>
said, &quot;the signs of a true apostle were performed among you with<br>
all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles&quot; (2<br>
Corinthians 12:12).<br>
<br>
However, signs and wonders would also accompany false teachers<br>
and false prophets (Matthew 7:21-23; 2 Peter 2:1-22). In fact,<br>
biblical references to signs and wonders in the last days are<br>
nearly all credited to false teachers, false prophets and false<br>
Christs (Matthew 24:11, 24). The false prophet in the tribulation<br>
&quot;deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which<br>
it was given him to perform&quot; (Revelation 13:14).<br>
<br>
Jesus is no longer with us in the flesh and there are no more<br>
apostles. Jesus identified the sign of a disciple as markedly<br>
different: &quot;By this all men will know that you are My disciples,<br>
if you have love for one another&quot; (John 13:35).<br>
<br>
Does this mean that signs and wonders have ceased? I certainly<br>
don't want to be identified with an evil generation that seeks<br>
only after a sign, but I also don't want to be associated with<br>
the powerless, anti-supernaturalism evidenced in Western<br>
rationalism. Both the power of God and the wisdom of God are<br>
expressed in Christ. Paul said, &quot;For indeed Jews ask for signs,<br>
and Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to<br>
Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those<br>
who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God<br>
and the wisdom of God&quot; (1 Corinthians 1:22-24).<br>
<br>
Lord, reveal to me the true source of my spiritual experiences.<br>
If they are not from You, I renounce them and command Satan to<br>
leave my presence.<br>

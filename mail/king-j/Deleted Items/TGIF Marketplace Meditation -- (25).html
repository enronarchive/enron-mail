First Fruits<br>
<br>
All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are<br>
sacred to the Lord and must go into His treasury.<br>
- (Joshua 6:19)<br>
<br>
<br>
One of the earliest examples of the practice of giving God the<br>
first fruits of the increase was when Joshua and the people<br>
entered the Promised Land for the first time. When they crossed<br>
the Jordan River, their first battle was Jericho. God set a<br>
precedent with this battle by instructing them not to take any<br>
spoils from it. Unlike future battles, the fruits from this<br>
victory were to go into the treasury as a remembrance of their<br>
first victory in the Promised Land. In addition, the city of<br>
Jericho was to be a lasting monument to God's faithfulness. God<br>
instructed Joshua never to rebuild this city. If they or anyone<br>
in the future attempted to rebuild the city, the life of the<br>
firstborn would be required. Years later, Ahab attempted to<br>
rebuild this city and his firstborn died as a result. God never<br>
forgets to enforce His Word.<br>
<br>
Is your work a lasting monument to the faithfulness of God in<br>
your life? Is it bringing glory to the Father? Are you giving the<br>
first fruits from your increase to God? God has encouraged us<br>
through this story to give the first fruits of our work to Him so<br>
that He will be glorified through our work. This is a tangible<br>
way for us to acknowledge that God is the source of all blessing.<br>

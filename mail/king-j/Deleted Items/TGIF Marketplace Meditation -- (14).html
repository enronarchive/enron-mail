Godly Rewards<br>
<br>
You have said, &quot;It is futile to serve God. What did we gain by<br>
carrying out His requirements and going about like mourners<br>
before the Lord Almighty? But now we call the arrogant blessed.<br>
Certainly the evildoers prosper, and even those who challenge God<br>
escape.&quot;<br>
- (Malachi 3:14-15)<br>
<br>
<br>
Have you ever felt that serving God had little reward and the<br>
ungodly seemed actually to be more blessed than you? This is what<br>
the people of God felt. God heard their cry and responded through<br>
the prophet Malachi to explain God's view on this matter.<br>
<br>
Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other, and the<br>
Lord listened and heard. A scroll of remembrance was written in<br>
His presence concerning those who feared the Lord and honored His<br>
name. &quot;They will be Mine,&quot; says the Lord Almighty, &quot;in the day<br>
when I make up My treasured possession. I will spare them, just<br>
as in compassion a man spares his son who serves him. And you<br>
will again see the distinction between the righteous and the<br>
wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not&quot;<br>
(Malachi 3:16-18).<br>
<br>
Notice that after the people complained about this, they began to<br>
talk to each other, and the Lord listened and heard. God had been<br>
taking note of those who were serving Him and honoring Him. There<br>
is a day coming in which God will honor His &quot;treasured<br>
possessions.&quot; We will see that there is a distinction between the<br>
righteous and the wicked on that day when &quot;the sun of<br>
righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. And you will<br>
go out and leap like calves released from the stall&quot; (Mal. 4:2).<br>
What a beautiful picture of what we will feel like on that day.<br>
<br>
Faithful obedience is rewarded by God. It often requires<br>
patience, suffering, and perseverance. Be of good cheer; He will<br>
reward you if you faint not.<br>

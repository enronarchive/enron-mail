Readers are cautioned that small and micro-cap stocks are<br>

portion of their investment if they make a purchase in our<br>
advertised stocks. In order to be in full compliance with<br>
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(b), we have<br>
received 25,000 free trading shares of Travelshorts.com<br>
Inc. from a third party as compensation for the<br>
distribution of this and other advertisements. Since we<br>
have received compensation and hold stock in the advertised<br>
company there is an inherent conflict of interest in our<br>
statements and opinions and such statements and opinions<br>
cannot be considered independent. We will benefit from any<br>
increase in share price of the advertised company. We will<br>
sell our shares at any time, without notice, be that<br>
before, during or immediately after the release of this<br>
advertisement. The liquidation of our stock may have a<br>
negative impact on the securities of the company<br>
liquidated, including decreased market value and/or<br>
dilution of the company's securities. Furthermore, our<br>
associates and/or employees and/or principals may have<br>
stock positions in advertised companies purchased in the<br>
open market or in private transactions. These positions may<br>
be liquidated, without prior notification, even after we<br>
have made positive comments regarding the advertised<br>
company. It should be understood that any price targets<br>
and/or projections mentioned are solely opinions and should<br>
not be taken as suggested holding periods. In fact, we will<br>

Reading this advertisement shall not create under any<br>
circumstances an offer to buy or sell stock in any company<br>
advertised. Nor shall it create any principal-agent<br>
relationship between the reader and us. The stocks of<br>
advertised companies may trade in fast moving, highly<br>
volatile markets, and any reader should observe the trading<br>
behavior of any advertised company prior to investing.<br>
Advertised stocks are often thinly traded and large sell<br>
orders will have a substantially negative impact on share<br>
price. Investors in advertised stocks may experience<br>
difficulty in selling shares without seeing a decline in<br>
market price and may have difficulty in finding ready<br>
buyers of their stock. Information within this<br>
advertisement contains &quot;forward looking&quot; statements within<br>
the meaning of Section 27(a) of the U.S. Securities Act of<br>
1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act<br>
of 1934. Any statements that express or involve discussions<br>
with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans,<br>
projections, objectives, goals, assumptions or future<br>
events or performance are not statements of historical<br>
facts and may be forward looking statements. Forward<br>
looking statements are based on expectations, estimates and<br>
projections at the time the statements are made that<br>
involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could<br>
cause actual results or events to differ materially from<br>
those presently anticipated. Forward looking statements may<br>
be identified through the use of words such as expects,<br>
will, anticipates, estimates, believes, or by statements<br>
indicating certain actions may, could or might occur. We<br>

found at http://www.sec.gov/consumer/cyberfr.htm. The NASD<br>
has published information on how to invest carefully at its<br>
web site. Readers can review all public filings by<br>
companies at the SEC s EDGAR page. All information within<br>

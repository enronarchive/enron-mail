Impossible Tasks<br>
<br>
But He answered, &quot;You give them something to eat.&quot;<br>
- (Mark 6:37)<br>
<br>
<br>
Has anyone ever asked you to do something that seems totally<br>
ridiculous? The very suggestion of their instruction may have<br>
brought laughter or even anger for proposing the idea.<br>
<br>
I imagine that the disciples may have felt this way when Jesus<br>
responded with this comment when they asked him how they were<br>
going to feed the 5000 who stayed around to hear him speak. The<br>
disciples suggested a logical answer to the problem, &quot;Send the<br>
people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and<br>
villages and buy themselves something to eat&quot; (Mk 6:36).<br>
<br>
That wasn't the answer Jesus wanted. He saw the need of the<br>
people. He had compassion on them. He wanted to solve the problem<br>
with a Kingdom response, not logic. He asked them what they had<br>
in their hand.<br>
<br>
So often what we already have in our hand is what Jesus wants us<br>
to use to solve our problems. We must add faith to what we<br>
already have in our hand. Then we will see the gospel of the<br>
Kingdom manifested to solve problems in a supernatural way. Jesus<br>
wanted to meet a need in which God would receive the glory.<br>
Sending the people away did not meet the need, nor did it bring<br>
glory to the Father.<br>
<br>
Do not settle for the gospel of salvation only. Jesus came that<br>
we might experience the gospel of the Kingdom in its fullest<br>
sense. Our job is to look past our logical reasoning and see how<br>
God might want to solve our problem in a supernatural way.<br>

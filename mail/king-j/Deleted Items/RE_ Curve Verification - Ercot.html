Those are 3 dates that i don't have.  I would have to go to the brokers.  Let me know if you need to do that.<br>

Subject:	Curve Verification - Ercot<br>
<br>
<br>
The estate has been working with traders in order to validate curves.    We are also talking with brokers and reviewing Megawatt Daily archives.<br>
Can I get some curve information from the Ercot team?   <br>
<br>
  I have three specific dates to verify:  11/30, 12/3 and 12/30.<br>
We are validating the marks for the daily, balmo, the prompt month and the cals.on the above mentioned dates.<br>
<br>
Do you have this information?<br>
<br>
I have talked to Peggy at APB.  She is willing to pass on info on the dailies,  but the historical data is something they want us to pay for.  I dont really need help with the daily stuff,  just the dates listed above.<br>
<br>
I would appreciate any help that you can give,<br>

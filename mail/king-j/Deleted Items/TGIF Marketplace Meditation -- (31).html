An Encounter With God<br>
<br>
So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no<br>
strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless.<br>
- (Daniel 10:8)<br>
<br>
<br>
Daniel received a vision that troubled him greatly. He wanted<br>
understanding of this vision. He set himself out to understand<br>
the vision by fasting for three weeks. Three days after his three<br>
weeks of fasting, a messenger of God appeared to Daniel. The<br>
messenger explained that Heaven had heard his prayer from the<br>
first day, but the angel was temporarily prevented from coming by<br>
the prince of Persia, a demon angel, who sought to thwart God's<br>
messenger from coming to Daniel.<br>
<br>
There are times in our lives when we must set ourselves to<br>
seeking God with all our hearts. It is in these times that we<br>
hear from Heaven in ways we may never have experienced before.<br>
Daniel's perseverance in prayer was rewarded with a personal<br>
encounter with Heaven. However, in order to receive from God,<br>
Daniel had to be left alone, his strength removed, and be placed<br>
in a helpless condition. When we have no ability in our own<br>
strength to move Heaven or the events around us, we are in<br>
position to hear from Heaven. It is the acknowledgment of our<br>
humanity and our frailness that places us in a position to have a<br>
personal encounter with the living God.<br>
<br>
Do you need a personal encounter with God today? Do you need God<br>
to intervene on your behalf? Seek Him with all your heart.<br>
Demonstrate to Him you are serious. Get alone and acknowledge<br>
your helpless condition before Him. He will reward you with His<br>
presence.<br>

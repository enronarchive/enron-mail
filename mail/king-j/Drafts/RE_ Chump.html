sorry dude, i had a wave of trading come through.  Your boy presto lifting all my stuff.  So what will you be doing at TXU?  I know several of the guys there.  They should have a good shop.  I sit about 20 feet from Baumbach now.  He's showing me how to trade gas for size.  <br>

Jeff, just thought I would drop you a line and see what is going on. Over<br>
at TXU now. Didn't see much upside staying UBS unfortunately. Thought I<br>
would be stuck in risk for years if I had stayed and wouldn't you know it,<br>
as soon as I leave I hear they start up a structuring desk again. Oh well.<br>
<br>
Hope things are going well,<br>
<br>
John<br>

Being an Overcomer<br>
<br>
I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace.<br>
In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have<br>
overcome the world.<br>
- (John 16:33)<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Why does it seem that those involved in Christian enterprise<br>
find the way so hard? It seems as though it is harder for those<br>
who are committed Christians in business. Have you found this to<br>
be true?&quot; This was the comment from a business associate<br>
recently. My answer was a definite yes. In fact, if you were not<br>
a Christian and sought to do a similar business without regard to<br>
maintaining a biblical philosophy, the way would be much smoother<br>
sailing. It makes us think of the prophet who asked, &quot;Why do the<br>
wicked prosper?&quot; (see Jer. 12:1)<br>
<br>
It is a spiritual principle of which we speak. When the<br>
Israelites crossed the Jordan before they entered the Promised<br>
Land, they fought only two battles. Then after they entered the<br>
Promised Land, they fought 39 battles. The way of the cross is<br>
not paved with lilies; it is paved with grace. When we seek to<br>
honor God in our business life, we will be met with opposition<br>
from the spiritual forces of this world. This is why each of us<br>
must commit ourselves to walking in the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
and to be as gentle as doves but as wise as serpents.<br>
<br>
Do not be surprised when you find the way harder as a believer<br>
than when you were a non-believer. You now have more at stake<br>
among the spiritual forces that desire you to be defeated and<br>
ineffective.<br>
<br>
Stand firm against the evil forces that desire to keep you from<br>
walking in freedom in the Promised Land. Jesus is your victory<br>
for every battle you will encounter. Call on His name.<br>

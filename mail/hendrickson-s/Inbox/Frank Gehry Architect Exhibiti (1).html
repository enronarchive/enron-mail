After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. <br>
<br>
To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our &quot;Ode to Why&quot; commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the &quot;Leading Company in the World.&quot;<br>
<br>
All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.<br>

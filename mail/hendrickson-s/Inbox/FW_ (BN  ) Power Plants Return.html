Power Plants Returning to Natural Gas as Prices Fall: Outlook<br>

Power Plants Returning to Natural Gas as Prices Fall: Outlook<br>
<br>
     Palatka, Florida, June 2 (Bloomberg) -- Natural gas is<br>
burning again at Florida Power &amp; Light Co.'s Putnam power plant in<br>
Palatka.<br>
     Last winter, Florida's largest utility reconfigured the plant<br>
to run on fuel oil instead of natural gas, a cleaner-burning fuel<br>
that for years had been comparatively cheap. Last month, as gas<br>
prices plunged to a 10-month low, the plant switched back to gas.<br>
     Florida Power &amp; Light wasn't the only one. Many electric<br>
utilities in the U.S. are able to burn both fuels, and several are<br>
making the switch to gas, which is now cheaper than oil in some<br>
regions. Companies such as Detroit Edison Co. had been burning oil<br>
since the winter.<br>
     ``It wasn't really until the early May timeframe, when gas<br>
and oil prices crossed paths and gas became cheaper,'' that the<br>
switch was made, said Gary Lapplander, the company's manager of<br>
fuel supply. Michigan's largest electric utility had been running<br>
its 780-megawatt Greenwood plant near Port Huron on oil since last<br>
December.<br>
     Fears of winter shortages drove natural gas futures on the<br>
New York Mercantile Exchange to a record $10.10 per million<br>
British thermal units in late December, more than quadruple the<br>
year-earlier price. This year, prices have fallen below $4, partly<br>
because last year's rally caused so many generators and industrial<br>
customers to seek alternate fuels, such as oil.<br>
<br>
                           Saving Money<br>
<br>
     Fuel can account for more than 90 percent of a power plant's<br>
operating costs, according to some estimates.<br>
     Mild weather across the U.S. this spring has reduced demand<br>
for gas to heat homes and power air conditioners, while record<br>
drilling in the past year has led to higher gas flows from U.S.<br>
wells. Since late March, utilities have been pumping gas into<br>
underground storage at almost three times last year's rate,<br>
according to American Gas Association figures.<br>
     Fuel oil has a much different story. Prices for No. 6<br>
residual fuel oil -- the grade most commonly burned in power<br>
plants -- are linked to crude oil prices, which have climbed 4<br>
percent this year.<br>
     The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has cut<br>
crude oil production twice this year after raising it four times<br>
in 2000. And refiners have been sopping up supplies in recent<br>
months to make gasoline for the summer driving season.<br>
     Natural gas prices at Chicago's distribution hub fell below<br>
fuel oil prices during the week ended May 18, the first time it<br>
was cheaper in almost seven months, according to Bloomberg<br>
figures. Fuel oil prices in Chicago are little changed this year.<br>
     ``It's really a factor of economics,'' said Carol Clawson, a<br>
spokeswoman for Juno Beach, Florida-based FPL Group Inc., parent<br>
of Florida Power &amp; Light, which can switch about a quarter of its<br>
power plants between gas and oil on a few hours' notice. ``We are<br>
detecting gas prices coming down, and as that occurs, we are going<br>
back to gas.''<br>
<br>
                          Fear of a Rally<br>
<br>
     To be sure, some power-plant operators may be wary of<br>
switching back to gas because of the chances for a rally this<br>
summer, said Tim Evans, senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus in<br>
New York. As hot weather arrives, homeowners and businesses will<br>
turn up their air conditioners, pushing electricity use higher and<br>
lifting gas demand. Natural gas futures last summer rose 29<br>
percent.<br>
     Adding to that demand, gas-fired power plants with about<br>
25,000 megawatts of capacity are expected to start up this summer,<br>
according to a U.S. Energy Department report published last month.<br>
Last year, about 22,000 megawatts of new gas plants started up,<br>
boosting total U.S. gas demand by 500 billion cubic feet, or 2.3<br>
percent. A megawatt is enough to light 1,000 homes.<br>
     Other variables in the gas market include the extent of any<br>
heat waves this summer, and whether hurricanes will enter the Gulf<br>
of Mexico, disrupting operations at offshore rigs that account for<br>
a quarter of U.S. production.<br>
     ``People don't fully trust gas,'' Evans said. ``They're<br>
wondering if it's going to remain the cheaper fuel, or if it's<br>
just going to turn around and do to them what it did last<br>
winter.''<br>
<br>
                           Still Cheaper<br>
<br>
     Oil is still cheaper than gas in some regions. In the New<br>
York City area, where utilities don't have to pay as much to get<br>
oil delivered from tanker terminals in New York harbor, heavy fuel<br>
oil costs $3.89 per million Btu, compared with $3.99 for natural<br>
gas, according to Bloomberg figures.<br>
     Even so, the drop in gas prices has prompted Brooklyn, New<br>
York-based Keyspan Energy Corp. to increase gas's share of its<br>
total power generation to about 40 percent, said company spokesman<br>
David Manning. That's up from about 3.5 percent at one point last<br>
December.<br>
     Normally, almost all of the company's plants would be burning<br>
gas at this time of year, Manning said. Keyspan produces power for<br>
about 1.1 million customers on Long Island.<br>
     ``We're right on the cusp'' of gas prices falling low enough<br>
to switch the remainder of the company's generation away from oil,<br>
he said. ``We would anticipate we will be running on gas even more<br>
this summer, unless something dramatic happens with the weather.''<br>

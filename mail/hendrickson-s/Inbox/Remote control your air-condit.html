NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees<br>
<br>
<br>
Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy <br>
bills.<br>
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 <br>
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote <br>
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers <br>
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow <br>
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, <br>
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket <br>
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy <br>
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot <br>
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up <br>
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and <br>
the size of your home.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Be among the first to participate absolutely free.<br>
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution <br>
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For <br>
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the <br>
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. <br>
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be <br>
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even <br>
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more <br>
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to <br>

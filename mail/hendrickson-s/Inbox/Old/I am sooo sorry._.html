I can't believe you're going to put them outside!  100% of the TIME?  That<br>
would be soooo difficult to do, I would end up letting them in, I have no<br>
discipline when it comes them, with their sweet, sweet faces!  I do think<br>
you are getting paid back for your lack of understanding for Barbara, it's<br>
terrible when those kind of things come back to haunt you.<br>
<br>
Which house is for sale, John's? Or that woman that never came outside?  Did<br>
I tell you that they raised my tax value on the Roseland house for 2001 to<br>
$231,000...what a joke!!! I#m sure that the purchaser will contest and win,<br>
he only paid 190,000 and that is the fair value.  Are prices going down in<br>
Montrose, what's the problem with the house by you, why isn't it selling?  I<br>
would love to be able to buy a place that cheap...my land here cost $300,000<br>
US!  The house alone here will be another $300,000 when it's<br>
finished...incredible.  Armin has a small one bedroom apartment that he paid<br>
$150,000 US for and we checked into selling it, evidently he bought when<br>
prices had peaked...we'd get have that for it if we sell...so I guess we are<br>
staying in the landlord business for now.  We just signed a new tenant, hope<br>
she's not a problem, the others we've had were no problem.<br>
<br>
I'm really sorry about the dog situation.  But what else can you do.  Oh,<br>
what we do for love and lust!  I left everything and moved to Germany and<br>
you're throwing your dogs outside.  Life has it's difficulties!<br>
<br>
How's your mom?  What#s happening with MDAnderson?<br>

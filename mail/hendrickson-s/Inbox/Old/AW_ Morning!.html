That's terrible about your mom.  It sounds like she will have a very rough<br>
road ahead.  I am so sorry.  We will be praying for her.  It must be<br>
terrible too to have to wait to get into MD Anderson.  Please give her our<br>
best and keep us posted, I am not familiar with that kind of cancer.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you were a winner in Vegas.  When's your next trip?  We arrive in<br>
Houston on July 4th, then go on the family vacation July 9 - 15 and depart<br>
Houston on th 18th.  We were hoping to get together with you all the friday<br>
after the 4th (the 6th??, I think).  Just let us know!<br>
<br>
We have just spent the whole morning trying to install the wiring in the<br>
walls of the break room for the internal vacuum system.  You have to run the<br>
wires thru the plastic pipes that are in the walls and sometimes, like today<br>
they just want go...so Armin had to destroy some of the wall.  It should<br>
have only been an hour job, but it turned into 5 hours!  All of our workers,<br>
except Claudia are on vacation this week, so we are trying to get some work<br>
done on our house.  there's so much work and sooooo little time.<br>
<br>
Now it's time for lunch...write when you can!<br>
<br>
Connie<br>

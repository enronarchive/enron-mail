Well, how was your weekend?  Sunshine?  MUST BE NICE!! We still had cold,<br>
rainy weather all weekend, but today we have SUNSHINE!!! AND our workers are<br>
actually installing OUR plumbing!  AND we are taking a TRIP!!! They say good<br>
things come in 3's, so I guess I have gotten my allotment.  Armin booked us<br>
on a flight to London for Friday morning, returning Tues night.  We are<br>
going to stay with Heather.  This is our first trip anywhere since the<br>
wedding last May.  Since she hasn't been there but a few weeks, we can take<br>
in all the sights together.  Now just have to find a dog sitter.<br>
<br>
Armin and JÃ¼rgen installed all the electrical for the guest room and 2 doors<br>
in the breakroom and bathroom over the weekend, so finally we are<br>
progressing on the house...THANK GOD!<br>
<br>
Well, can you believe it...my Melissa is 24 today.  incredibly.  And Tory<br>
will be 6 on Sat! They are all doing good still, I am so happy for them that<br>
things have worked out so great.<br>
<br>
How is it going with your Mom?  Any luck with MD Anderson yet?<br>
<br>
Well, gotta run...we are picking up some more doors this afternoon.<br>
<br>

Oh, Scott, that is so great about your mom!!! But that is also soooo<br>
interesting about thalidomide....I think of that drug alot here, because you<br>
see the effects of the children here alot, well they aren't children<br>
anymore...they are my age, but they are everywhere here.  so that drug works<br>
on cancer?!?!?!? incredible!  does it have any side effects? (other than on<br>
babies)<br>

MMMM....liquid manure!  I hardly ever get that in the city!!!<br>
<br>
I'm glad you'll be doing your business in private now!!!<br>
<br>
By  the way, my mom finally got to see the doctor at MD Anderson yesterday.<br>
They are going to put her in clinical trial where she'll be treated with<br>
thalidomide (the drug that caused the deformed babies in the late sixties).<br>
She starts that next week.  She had to promise not to have a baby!  That<br>
should be pretty easy to live up to since she has no uterus and my dad's<br>
been fixed!!!  Anyway, we're hoping that it slows things down, or puts it<br>
in remission altogether.<br>
<br>

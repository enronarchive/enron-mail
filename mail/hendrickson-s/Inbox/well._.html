<div id=msg_body>
I'm still here at the office...the customer's have my car blocked<br>
in...sooooo...I guess I will stay awhile longer.  did I tell you that the<br>
workers have finished installing our toilet flushing system?? We have 6<br>
toilets and they have been set up where they can be flushed with water from<br>
our rainwater cistern (it holds like 30,000 gallons).  cool huh, water is so<br>
expensive here and rain is free!  Armin is talking with the customers about<br>
doing it, but they are thinking they want to wash their clothes with it<br>
too...i don't think that's such a good idea, the water is not purified...but<br>
the washingmachine does heat itself, it doesn't use a hot water heater...so<br>
I &quot;guess&quot; it could be ok...<br>
<br>
Anyway...I'M BORED!!! you could write me!!!!<br>

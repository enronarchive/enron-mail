We are still getting to enjoy sunshine, but there's a very cool wind.<br>
Yesterday was the anniversary of when we met...6 years ago!  Seems longer.<br>
We dined at AÃŸmann's, of course..our favorite place.<br>
<br>
London was great!  I took my Goretex jacket and it rained about every 15<br>
mins or so most everyday, but it wasn't too cold so that was no problem.  We<br>
were shocked at how expensive all the tourist stuff was...30 DM per person<br>
to go to the Aquarium!  Everything was like that, but we did all that we had<br>
time for.  The riots on May 1st made us detour a little bit, so that we<br>
didn't get to see the Crown Jewels, next time we will make that 1st on the<br>
list.  We really enjoyed the parks, the pubs and Heather's company.  But we<br>
aren't city people, we where ready to get out of the hustle and bustle and<br>
come home to our boring little lives.  I loved the fish and chips that we<br>
got at The Bag of Nails Pub, other than Pubs we mostly ate italian.  It was<br>
cool seeing the Windsor Castle and all the old stuff.  Heather has a nice<br>
flat, with a great location, right by Buckingham palace.  She's having a<br>
blast there!  I would like to see the countryside next time.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it's going to be awhile before you are more than &quot;just ok&quot;.  I am very<br>
sorry.  It's good that you are keeping busy.<br>
<br>
so what are you going to do about your job?  I can honestly say I am happier<br>
in this job than I've ever been...but the boss can be a little difficult<br>
sometimes!!!<br>
<br>
Gotta go for lunch! Write me!<br>

[IMAGE]     3/4 cup  white grape juice   2 tablespoons  olive oil or cooking oil   2 tablespoons  lime juice   1-1/2 teaspoons  snipped fresh rosemary or 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crushed   2 cloves  garlic, minced   1/8 teaspoon  ground cinnamon          1 pound  boneless lamb round steak or sirloin steak, cut into 1-inch cubes    2 cups baby  carrots (about 1/2 pound)   2 medium  zucchini or yellow summer squash, sliced into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-thick  pieces   1 large green  or red sweet pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces   Fresh rosemary  (optional)   		<br>
		<br>
     1. For marinade, in a screw-top jar combine grape juice, oil,  lime juice, rosemary, garlic, and cinnamon. Cover and shake well. Place  lamb cubes in a plastic bag set in a shallow dish. Pour marinade over  lamb; close bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 hours, turning once  to distribute marinade. Drain lamb cubes, reserving marinade.      2. Trim  carrots, leaving 1/2 to 1 inch of stem, if desired. Scrub but do not peel.  Cook carrots in a small amount of boiling water for 3 minutes. Add zucchini  or summer squash and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more or until vegetables  are crisp-tender; drain.  3. On eight  8-inch skewers, alternately thread lamb cubes, whole carrots, zucchini  or summer squash, and green or red sweet pepper.  4. Place kabobs  on an uncovered grill directly over hot coals. Grill for 8 to 12 minutes  for medium doneness, brushing with reserved marinade and turning kabobs  occasionally. Garnish with sprigs of fresh rosemary, if desired.

1. LOOKING FORWARD<br>
Our Take: Bullish In Choppy Seas<br>
<br>
Economic and Market Outlook:<br>
<br>
Indicators point in both directions. The economy is still sluggish and the<br>
industries are still in pain. Though recovery in the overall economy is<br>
still blurred, recovery in some sectors seems on its way. The stock market<br>
turned around after the April 4 debacle, but showed considerable<br>
hesitation to move up last month. It took a step back for every step<br>
forward. The Nasdaq slipped 0.27% for the month of May; the Dow showed<br>
some strength, rising 1.6% in May.<br>
<br>
Though the bullish trend is back and we can expect to see the markets<br>
rising further in the next few months, the seas are choppy and frictional<br>
factors will continue to pose hurdles in the upswing. A heartening fact is<br>
that in April, $21 billion was invested in mutual funds as compared to a<br>
net withdrawal of $20.6 billion in March. Further, the IPO market is<br>
finally looking up and investors are treating the new issues fairly well.<br>

2. LAST WEEK<br>
<br>
Economic and Market Update:<br>
<br>
The markets edged up still further this week, though the gains were not<br>
impressive. More bad news flooded the market and investors were hesitant<br>
to sell.  The oil and biotech sectors were strong; the chip sector<br>
turned in a depressed performance before shifting gears on Thursday.<br>
Guidance from Intel Corp. (INTC) and Applied Micro Devices (AMD) that<br>
earnings will be in line with previous expectations infused the markets<br>
with enthusiasm.<br>
Intel guidance: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11865<br>
<br>
On the economic front, initial jobless claims for the week rose to<br>
432,000, the highest since 1992 and productivity declined 1.2% for the<br>
first quarter, more than the expected 0.8% decline. This was the first<br>
fall in total worker output per hour since 1993. Unit labor costs, an<br>
important gauge of inflation, rose 6.3%.<br>
<br>
Fed chief Alan Greenspan has repeatedly stressed the importance of<br>
productivity in the U.S. economy to contain inflation and spur growth,<br>
and the economic data this week dimmed the optimism. However, in a speech<br>
in Singapore, Greenspan reiterated that inflation was not an issue and<br>
that the rise in crude oil prices was temporary.<br>

Productivity: http://www.123jump.com/story.htm?story_id=11799<br>
<br>
Spirits were dampened further when Federal Reserve Governor Meyer stated<br>
that he expects the economy to be sluggish into the second half of the<br>
year. His view echoed the statement by Fed Bank of Richmond President<br>
Alfred Broaddus, that the economy may have not yet have hit the bottom<br>
and more rate cuts may be necessary to prevent a recession.<br>
<br>
News at the industry level also did not look good. IDC reported that it<br>
expects U.S. PC shipments to decline 6.3% in 2001, the first annual<br>
decline ever. The Semiconductor Industry Association said that chip sales<br>
could fall 14% this year. Further, they felt that PC and chip sales are<br>
expected to be anemic even in 2002.<br>

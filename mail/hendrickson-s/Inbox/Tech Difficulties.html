Good evening!<br>
Here is your Money Mail for Friday, June 8.<br>
<br>
BUZZ AT THE BELL<br>
Technology worries and technical difficulties conspired to<br>
send stocks lower Friday. A profit warning from Juniper<br>
Networks deflated telecom-equipment shares, while a<br>
computer glitch halted New York Stock Exchange trading for<br>
more than an hour.<br>
<br>
Late in the session, the Nasdaq Composite stood 2.2-percent<br>
lower, down 49 to 2,215. The Dow Jones industrial average<br>
fell 114 to 10,977 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 12<br>
to 1,265.<br>
<br>
Shares of Juniper, which designs and sells products in<br>
direct competition with networking behemoth Cisco, tumbled<br>
more than 18 percent to 38.02. The company said its<br>
second-quarter profits would disappoint investors and<br>
announced layoffs of between 8 and 9 percent of its staff.<br>
Cisco fell 6.1 percent and Redback Networks slid 7.6<br>
percent to put a red exclamation point on a volatile week.<br>
<br>
Many chip stocks also fell, partly in sympathy with their<br>
networking brethren but also on profit-taking and lingering<br>
fears about the future of chip demand. Intel lost 1.5<br>
percent a day after it told analysts profits for its latest<br>
quarter would be about what the company expected in its<br>
last forecast. (Intel shares still finished up more than 7<br>
percent for the week.) National Semiconductor fell 6.2<br>
percent, but Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's biggest rival<br>
in the microprocessor business, actually rose 2.7 percent.<br>
<br>
Computer peripherals, cellular-phone companies and<br>
specialty manufacturers rounded out the day's biggest<br>
losers. Few sectors made any impressive headway. Gold<br>
stocks jumped 4.6 percent but other gainers were up less<br>
than 2 percent.<br>

SCOUTING REPORT: NEXT WEEK<br>
As punctuated by the Juniper warning, second-quarter<br>
confession season has the market in its thrall. Keep a<br>
close watch on conference calls and analyst meetings -- you<br>
at least get a little warning before them. But there's no<br>
way to brace for those pure, bolt-from-the-blue profit<br>
warnings sure to come in the weeks ahead.<br>
<br>
Economically speaking, inflation figures top next week's<br>
calendar. The producer and consumer price indexes will be<br>
released Thursday and Friday, respectively. Inflation has<br>
become a back-burner issue, something the Federal Reserve<br>
seems unconcerned about. But do keep an eye on<br>
precious-metals stocks, which have risen in recent weeks<br>
(though fallen back a bit lately). Rallying gold stocks<br>
sometimes hint that investors are betting on an inflation<br>
pickup.<br>
<br>
<br>
ECONOMIC CALENDAR:<br>
Wednesday<br>
*Retail sales for May, forecast: +0.2 percent<br>
Thursday<br>
*Producer price index for May, forecast: +0.2 percent<br>
*Weekly jobless claims, forecast: +410,000<br>
Friday<br>
*Consumer price index for May, forecast: +0.3 percent<br>
<br>
<br>
STOCKS<br>
* Intel's Visibility Only Half the Battle *<br>
Investors applauded the chip giant's forecasting prowess<br>
this week. But analysts say profit growth needs to pick up.<br>

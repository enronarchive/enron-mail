Lesson Number One<br>
<br>
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day.<br>
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, &quot;Can I also sit like you and<br>
<br>
do nothing all day long?<br>
The crow answered: &quot;Sure, why not.&quot; So, the rabbit sat on the ground<br>
! below the crow, and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on<br>
the<br>
rabbit and ate it.<br>
<br>
Management Lesson: To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting<br>
<br>
very, very high up.<br>
<br>
Lesson Number Two<br>
<br>
A turkey was chatting with a bull. &quot;I would love to be able to get to<br>
the top of that tree,&quot; sighed the turkey, &quot;but I haven't got the energy.<br>
&quot;Well,<br>
why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?&quot; replied the bull.<br>
&quot;They're<br>
packed with nutrients.&quot; The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found<br>
that it<br>
actually gave him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree.<br>
<br>
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.<br>
<br>
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of<br>
the tree.<br>
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the<br>
<br>
tree.<br>
<br>
Management Lesson: Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep<br>
<br>
you there.! <br>
<br>
Lesson Number Three<br>
<br>
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to<br>
be Boss. The Brain said, &quot;I should be Boss because I control the whole<br>
body's responses and functions.&quot; The feet said, &quot;We should be Boss as<br>
we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.&quot; The<br>
hands<br>
said, &quot;We should be the Boss because we do all the work and earn all the<br>
<br>
money.&quot;<br>
And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes until<br>
finally the asshole spoke up. All the parts laughed at the idea of the<br>
asshole<br>
being the Boss. So the asshole went on strike, blocked itself up and<br>
refused to work. Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands<br>
<br>
clenched, the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the<br>
brain fevered. Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be<br>
the<br>
Boss, so the motion was passed. All the other parts did all the work<br>
while the<br>
Boss just sat and passed out th! e shit!<br>
<br>
Management Lesson: You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole<br>
will do.<br>
<br>
Lesson Number Four<br>
<br>
A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold, the Bird<br>
froze and fell to the ground in a large field. While it was lying there,<br>
<br>
a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. As the frozen bird lay there<br>
in<br>
the pile of cow dung, it began to realize how warm it was. The dung was<br>
actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon<br>
began to sing<br>
for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate.<br>
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow<br>
dung, and<br>
promptly dug him out and ate him!<br>
<br>
Management Lessons:<br>
<br>
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy.<br>
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.<br>
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut.<br>

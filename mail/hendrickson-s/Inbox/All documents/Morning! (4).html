I heard that they were looking to fill all the slots over there with<br>
Analysts, hope they know what they are doing, at least until I get all my<br>
stock sold!  Which is not looking good again?!?!? What's with that close<br>
yesterday?<br>
<br>
so HPL was sold...that means Kenny has to go too?  He should look for<br>
another spot at ENE, Dwayne is BAD NEWS FOR HIM.  Do you think he's<br>
prejudice against Greg too?<br>
<br>
Are you gonna look for something else?<br>
<br>
We'Ve had great sunshine weather this week!  But cold still.  All the bulbs<br>
are coming up, we should have flowers soon.  I want the builder to get his<br>
crap off my land so I can start planting!  We need grass and FLOWERS!!!<br>
<br>
Well it#s time for lunch, we're having Greek today, stuffed bell peppers<br>
with feta in a tomatoe sauce with rice and salad!  I'm starving!!!  Since<br>
Claudia started working for us I'm getting FAT!  It's so nice not to do ALL<br>
the cooking and none of the cleaning!  When you visit you will get to sample<br>
of cooking...I think you will like it.<br>
<br>
Gotta go, write!!!<br>

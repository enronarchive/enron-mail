I gave up on the messenger thing.  The msn totally screwed up my<br>
computer..it said I didn't have enough space or something like that then it<br>
sent a print job to my computer that printed 40 pages with 1 or 2 symbols on<br>
it.  It's over.  Armin will have to work on that shit.  When he has time and<br>
is back.<br>
<br>
I can't tell how big the house is right now.  I thought it looked small from<br>
the inside, but I thought that about the office too and now that it's<br>
finished I realize that the office is 2 x's as big as the one at the<br>
Scharnberger's..it's huge.  I think the house is a little bit less than<br>
3,000 sq ft of living space, mostly on the ground floor.  Remember we have<br>
an acre of land to fill up.  But when you stand inside it doesn't seem big<br>
at all!  On the ground floor is the master bedroom/bath, guestroom/bath,<br>
foyer (and it IS HUGE), kitchen, dining, living room, utility room and walk<br>
in pantry.  The second floor has a bedroom/bath, archive file room, and a<br>
galary (that's what's behind most of the windows on the second floor).  The<br>
rooms are not big (I don't think).<br>
<br>
Now the warehouse IS BIG.  I drive my car in there and do circles.  But<br>
Armin will eventually fill it up.  The I will use my private garage, it's<br>
big enough for a work truck and my car.  Just want it all finished!!!!<br>

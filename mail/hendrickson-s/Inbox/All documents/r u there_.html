Haven't heard much from you..are you vacationing???  Are just having a big<br>
Valentine's celebration?  I'll be lucky if I get to see my husband for<br>
Valentines!  But I did get roses...from the HOUSEKEEPER!  She's so sweet.<br>
<br>
Well the &quot;Control&quot; police hit me again today...but this time only one.  He<br>
was checking out our german workers, to see if they were &quot;illegals&quot;.  It's<br>
so funny, they KNOW I'm not german, but there never question my legal or<br>
illegal status.  It's because I'm American.  If I spoke with an Eastern<br>
Europe accent, they'd be all over me.  Prejudices are world wide.<br>
Obviously, there are either toooo many of these police or tooo little work<br>
for them to do to keep bothering me.<br>
<br>
So what's your Valentine plans???<br>
<br>

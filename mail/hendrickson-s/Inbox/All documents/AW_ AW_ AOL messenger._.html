Ok, i tried all day yesterday until 8 pm.  I was hoping that armin would<br>
have some time to look at it with me last evening, but he was too busy with<br>
work, so I went home.  I tried again today..no luck.  Maybe I have a<br>
firewall or something?!?!? you know I hate this kind of crapppp....it all<br>
should just WORK!<br>
<br>
We had snow again this morning, but not too much, looks like someone<br>
springled powder sugar on everything.  I'm ready for that to stop.  But at<br>
least I didn't have to scrap ice off the car this morning!  I wish I had<br>
just one of the garages at the apartment that I have here!  I think You<br>
could easily park 10 cars in the warehouse!  I push the button drive in and<br>
do circles!  But Armin will soon fill alot of it up with that work stuff of<br>
his.  He has my private garage full of insulation AND the automatic opener<br>
isn't installed yet...he has sooooo many projects to do!!<br>
<br>
I have a wonderful husband but I have the MOTHER IN LAW FROM HELL!!! She has<br>
pissed everyone off so bad that she can't find anyone that will except a<br>
vacation in Greece with her.  Everyone that she has taken, she has worked<br>
them to death and NO ONE is willing to go with her again.  I can't begin to<br>
tell you how trully horrible this woman is!  And the worst part is... IT'S<br>
ARMIN'S MOTHER!  It makes him so sad that she is so terrible.  Do you have<br>
any in law problems?  Do they know you and everything?  I sure wish I didn#t<br>
know mine.  Or they could just move permently to Greece, that would be good.<br>
Do your parents know Rayfael?  How are you parents?  Please tell them hello<br>
for me!<br>
<br>
Well, gotta work some more!<br>
later,<br>
Connie<br>

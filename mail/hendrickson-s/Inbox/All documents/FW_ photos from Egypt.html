I have returned from Egypt. We had a great time. The weather was great and<br>
the tour was well organized. But, it is good to be back. I will write more<br>
later. They missed me at work it looks like I will be busy for a while.<br>

Dear mom, Bruce, and Unlce Lex,<br>
   Greetings from an overcast and chilly Istanbul. It<br>
is Sunday afternoon and I am back safe and sound. I<br>
hope Bruce your travels went well.<br>
   Yesterday morning I took a cab to the Islamic<br>
museum and it was indeed as good as I had hoped- and<br>
empty &amp; cheap to boot. No problems with our Hashem<br>
(our agent) picking me up and transferring me back to<br>
the hotel and then the airport. I met Brandi in the<br>
waiting lounge and it seems she too had the same<br>
distressing reports about Doing Egypt on your own on<br>
the cheap. She was harrassed a lot (sexually and<br>
otherwise) and generally felt lost and unhappy a lot.<br>
I think we definitely made the right move to do it the<br>
way we did.<br>
   My flight was uneventful and her boyfriend met us<br>
at the airport and had gotten us a ride home. I had a<br>
great homecoming. My good friend Christine from<br>
Ireland came over and we went to a fun party given by<br>
a gay Brit friend last night- home after 2pm!<br>
   I got up and went to church and it was nice to see<br>
friends there. Afterwards coffee with my friend Terry<br>
and then shopping and relaxing here. My home is fine<br>
and Sultan is happy to have me back. What a super<br>
vacation! I am relaxed and energized. Have already<br>
done a load of laundry and soon will do yoga.<br>
   Great to hear from you mom from the boat and hope<br>
you have a great time. Nice that you arrived to find<br>
flowers from the Millers. Enjoy!<br>
    Bruce I suppose you could copy this letter to send<br>
on to mom. I assume you got the same email I did from<br>
her on the boat.<br>
    I love you all- gillian<br>

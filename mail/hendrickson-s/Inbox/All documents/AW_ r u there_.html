We'd love for ya'll to come visit!  My family vacation is in July, so we are<br>
planning on comig to Houston around the 4th of July and leaving July 18, so<br>
either the first part of our trip or the last we have to hook up.  Armin's<br>
dying for Cafe Adobe!!! And a relaxing vacation.  The rest of the year we<br>
are here, until Christmas...I want to spend that back in the states<br>
(hopefully).<br>
<br>
I have to tell you what Angus is doing..he cracks me up!  He loves to<br>
sunbathe, back when we were at the apartment and the sun would come out, he<br>
would ask to go outside and sit in a chair on the front porch (of course he<br>
would wait until I put a cushion in it).  Well here at the office the sun<br>
comes in the south window most all day, he loves it.  But he has a problem<br>
in the morning when it is only shining on the west wall.  so each day he<br>
goes over to the wall and starts tapping on it with his foot!  Like he can<br>
bring the sunshine down on the floor to him!!! Then he stares at me to fix<br>
it!!!  He's so entertaining!<br>
<br>
So who were you partying with on Tues?  What's Greg McClendon up to these<br>
days?  Does he ever do anything with you or Julie anymore?  I never hear<br>
about him.<br>
<br>
Well, back to work for a while!<br>
Later..connie<br>
<br>

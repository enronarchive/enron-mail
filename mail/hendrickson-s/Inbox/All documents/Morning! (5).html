Well, I am in shock about Frank...I just NEVER would have thought it of him.<br>
Did Susan say how Karen is doing?  Is she working again?  It really makes me<br>
sad when things like that happen.  Why can't people just keep their<br>
commitments, why does it hardly ever work out that people stay together<br>
anymore...like our parents did...<br>
<br>
How's your mom doing today?  Is she still in shock?  Please keep us posted<br>
on how things are going for her.  We will keep her in our prayers.<br>
<br>
Write when you can,<br>
connie<br>

PS What does Susan and Renato think about what Frank has done???<br>

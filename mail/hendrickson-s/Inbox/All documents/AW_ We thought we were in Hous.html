No, I can't say that Argentine beef is better than American, but it IS<br>
better than German (they just can't grow OR cut a cow right over here)!<br>
<br>
Yeah, I used ChemLawn on my house in Copperfield, and they said once it's<br>
dry it's fine for the dogs, and I did have a really nice yard...but I think<br>
that was after I stopped them and started using Rob Townsend...anyway my<br>
garten now SUCKS!  It'S FULL  OF CRAPP, lumber, building stuff and a huge<br>
crane that just won't go away!!!<br>
<br>
You really would like the movie we saw, maybe it will come there with<br>
untertitel in English, but you would understand it in Deutsch...it's about<br>
an Experiment that was done, I think at the Univ of Cal.  They took 20<br>
people, made 10 prisoners and 10 their guards..in reality they had to stop<br>
the experiment after 7 days because things were getting out of control...in<br>
the movie they carried it on further..it was great!  Very intense, very<br>
blooooody in the end!<br>
<br>
I can't BELIEVE that you stayed home for St Patty's!  I watched a<br>
documentary on Ireland and St Patty's and now I understand why it's a bigger<br>
celebration outside of Ireland than in Ireland.  I have a great new channel<br>
on my satellite, the English Travel channel...IT'S GREAT!  They have all<br>
kinds of shows on countries all over the world, AND IT'S IN ENGLISH!!!<br>
<br>
That's terrible that someone tried to pull up your plant, do you remember<br>
that they stole a clay pot of dirt from me over there, incredible!  No, here<br>
we don't have that trouble...YET!  Maybe in 15 - 20 years it will come.  I<br>
hope not.  I have such nice plants in pots outside the office and really<br>
pretty garten art in it, it would be gone in a second in Montrose!<br>
<br>
So what#S Happenning in NEw York for you and Julie???<br>
<br>
I still haven't been able to do my taxes because of WELLSFARGO!!! They have<br>
my mortgage now and I CANNOT get my 1098 from them, I have written them,<br>
faxed them, emailed them and finally today telephoned them...I WAS ON HOLD<br>
FOR A REP FOR OVER 15 MINUTES!!! I chewed her ass out when she finally got<br>
on the phone and the bitch said she wasn't allowed to FAX IT TO ME!  I told<br>
her she would not only fax me my interest for 2000 BUT ALSO THE PAYOFF,<br>
because I would not have a mortgage at such a piece of &quot;)o($/ company as<br>
theirs....I did'nt mention that I had sold the house.<br>
<br>
Everything is on track for the sale, we close on May 4th and I GET MY<br>
MONEY...HONEY!!!!<br>
<br>
Well it's late and I want to go home...take care..connie<br>

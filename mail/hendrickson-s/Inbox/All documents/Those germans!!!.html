Well our first week in our new office has been quite an experience.  Armin<br>
is only in the office late at night, so I am up here on this hill all alone<br>
during the day, just me and Angus.  On Monday a man came from some<br>
department of the government to &quot;control&quot; the office... he wanted to check<br>
that we have everything required by law for our employees.  Since only the<br>
office is finished he kindly said he would come back in the fall, he was<br>
very nice.<br>
<br>
On Tuesday another man came from the government, once again to &quot;control&quot; the<br>
employees, same kind of stuff as the 1st man, just another branch of the<br>
government.  Since only the office is finished he kindly said he would come<br>
back in the fall, he was very nice too.  Both of these men showed me ID,<br>
even though it meant nothing to me.<br>
<br>
Then on Wednesday, there was loud knocking on the office door and I walked<br>
down the stairs to see about 15 MEN CONVERGING ON MY WHOLE BUILDING!  They<br>
were all dressed in plain clothes, jeans and stuff, and had arrived in<br>
several dark colored cars and a white van.  I opened the door and some of<br>
them came in.  The one in charge spoke to me but I only  understood the<br>
words customs and control the employees!  They were looking everywhere and<br>
looking at me quite strangely.  I was very uncomfortable not know WHO OR<br>
WHAT they were.  When the leader realized that I spoke better English than<br>
German, he spoke to the others..&quot;ENGLISH!&quot; and then another one came from<br>
the rear and began questioning me in English.  He wanted to know where the<br>
employees were, if I was alone, what I was doing...he then realized that<br>
there was a business working out this building and asked if it was mine, I<br>
QUICKLY said NO, IT'S MY HUSBANDS!  He then wanted all the details about our<br>
buisness, what we did, how many employees etc.  I was so puzzeled and he<br>
could see it.  They all started smiling at each other then just said, this<br>
IS your address for the buisiness, Schleehofstr. 14?  I said yes and he said<br>
OK, fine.  Then, they all packed up and left.<br>
<br>
I didn't see or talk to Armin until he came home for lunch.  I explained to<br>
him what had happened and he was shocked too.  He said that's never happened<br>
to his business before.  Then the more we talked about it, it began to<br>
become clear what they had really been there to do and why.  Our building<br>
looks and is still very much under construction, even though no one but me<br>
is working here right now.  But the company that built the structure still<br>
has their mobile office here and their workers meet here each morning before<br>
going in company trucks to their new jobsite, leaving their autos out front<br>
on the street.  The men had been with the german immigration police.<br>
Someone must have called in that there were illegal aliens working at this<br>
address!  When they arrived they saw all the cars and came in to carry off<br>
any illegals in there van that were working on the jobsite, they really had<br>
no interest in our buisiness or employees!  So yes, I got raided on my 3rd<br>
day here in our new office.  Armin said that they should have shown me some<br>
ID and never open the door again unless I see ID...LIKE GERMAN ID IS GOING<br>
TO MEAN ALOT TO ME THRU A GLASS DOOR?!?!?  What an experience.<br>
<br>
So how's things going with you?  I got the aol thing and will try to get<br>
that set up.  But mostly when you are online at your house, I'm asleep.<br>
Write when you can!<br>
<br>

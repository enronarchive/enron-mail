I was out sick yesterday, and was in the bathroom when you called (taking <br>
care of one end or the other!), then I passed out soon thereafter.  I feel <br>
much better to day, and am at work.  I'll take a raincheck on the food until <br>
tomorrow or Thursday (whichever works for you).<br>
<br>
Julie  :-)<br>

Where are you?  I was offended when you didn't return my phone call <br>
yesterday!!!<br>
<br>
I'm volunteering to go eat seafood with you if you're interested :-)~  (Not <br>
at the super expensive place, though.)<br>
<br>
You have to see my two walls, too!!!<br>

<div id=msg_body>
Well we have had our first accident at the new building...But it really wasn't<br>
the building's fault...Armin and Lolo worked all evening installing the <br>
largest<br>
of our 3 garage doors on the warehouse.  It's a really tall and wide door, so<br>
that large trucks can pull all the way into the warehouse to unload.  Well, <br>
all<br>
went well with the installation, and it was time for them to go.   Lolo closed<br>
and locked the garage door while Armin loaded up his work truck to leave.<br>
When Armin slammed the sliding side door shut, he somehow forgot to let go<br>
with his left hand...so the door slammed shut with his fingers in it.  That's<br>
not the worst, Armin had locked the door before he slammed it shut!  It was<br>
locked with his fingers smashed inside!!!  That's STILL not the worst!  He had<br>
already cranked the truck, so the keys were in the ignition on the oposite <br>
side<br>
of the truck from where he was trapped!!!!<br>
<br>
Thank GOD LOLO HADN'T LEFT YET!!! He got the keys and unlocked the door, <br>
freeing<br>
Armin's smashed 3 middle fingers.  If he would've been alone there, as he<br>
normally is late at night, it would've been terrible!!!<br>
<br>
So he came home around 10:30 PM in shock with pain.  He took aspirin and was<br>
finally able to sleep about 1 AM.  This morning he could move them, but they <br>
are<br>
swollen and purple and very painful.  Of course, he won't go to the doctor, He<br>
says that they aren't broken ? ? ? But he is in a lot of pain.  He must have<br>
been terribly tired to do something so stupid.  He needs to take a break, but <br>
he<br>
won't...hopefully when Melissa and family get here he will slow down.<br>
<br>
Hope you all are having a safe week!<br>
<br>
Connie<br>

I know I'm a little late, but the wishes were there for you when we toasted in<br>
the New Years here!<br>
<br>
We got Melissa and family off to the airport yesterday morning, then headed <br>
into<br>
the office for our 1st day as business owners...I won't even go into how bad<br>
that afternoon was, I don't have the energy right now.  But even when things<br>
were at their very lowest, and GOD KNOWS THEY WERE!! there was a wonderful<br>
silver lining, NO IT'S A GOLD/DIAMOND LINING!!! Claudia!!! She is the greatest<br>
maid/cook on the face of this earth!  I came home to a beautiful spotless <br>
house<br>
yesterday and to a great cooked meal today and ALL I HAD TO DO WAS GO TO<br>
WORK!!!! Can't beat that!  I don't have to tell her anything!  She#s been<br>
feeding me for over 5 years, so she knows just what and how I like stuff and<br>
she's an immaculate housekeeping!  To top it all off, she's good company too,<br>
a real cut up.  Can't wait until you get to come taste her cooking!<br>
<br>
But things aren't looking good for getting the house finished for April.  We<br>
have so much work with the business right now that Armin doesn't know how he<br>
will have time to work on the house.  We are really lucky, alot of companies <br>
are<br>
in bad shape because they have no work, and the business comes first.  He is<br>
making time to get the office finished.  Tonight Lolo, Mitch, and J_rgen are<br>
helping him.  The painter is to come Fri morn then hopefully carpet the next<br>
week!  I have reached the TOTAL EXPLODE STAGE WITH BOTH HIS PARENTS.  Like I<br>
said I can't even go into right now....<br>
<br>
So what all did you do over the holidays?  We had a really nice time with<br>
Melissa and family and they did make it home ok this time.  We had snow, so <br>
Tory<br>
was happy.  But today it warmed up to 50F??? Weird weather.<br>
<br>
Write when you can!<br>

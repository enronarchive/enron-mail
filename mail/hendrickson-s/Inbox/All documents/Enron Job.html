<br>
Dear Rayfael-<br>
<br>
I did get in contact with the head of our research group today and passed <br>
along your resume.<br>
<br>
For your information, his name is Stinson Gibner (a really nice guy) and his <br>
phone number here at work is 713-853-4748.  He is the Vice President over the <br>
group and sounded interested in talking with you.  He said that he would call <br>
you and set up an &quot;informal&quot; talk.  The next step would be to come in for the <br>
formal interviews, which Scott can tell you how much fun that process is!!  I <br>
would suggest that you follow up with Stinson in a couple of days if he has <br>
not called you by then.<br>
<br>
The entry level job in Stinson's group for someone with your level of <br>
education is called a Sr. Speicalist.  The pay range for this job <br>
classification is $41,300 to $87,600.  At this level you could come in and <br>
learn the financial side of the business which will help you to progress <br>
through the job hierarchy.<br>
<br>
I am glad to have gotten something productive done today.  After being gone <br>
for a week it was a big fat mess in my office today.  To top it all off, I <br>
had to wait at home for over two hours for the police because my house was <br>
burglerized while I was in New York last week!  They just took a couple of <br>
rings from my jewerly box (nothing big), but they were from my trip to <br>
Cartegena, Columbia and cannot be easily replaced!  It's always something!!<br>
<br>
Oh well,<br>
<br>
Hope you have a great evening...<br>
<br>
Julie  :-)<br>

Well....I don't expect that any of you will attend...BUT I want you to know <br>
that<br>
you are INVITED and we wish with all our hearts that you could be here.<br>
<br>
As far as how long before we are in the house...well that depends on the <br>
market,<br>
you have to remember that I am paying for all of the personal part of our<br>
building with MY money.  The house will be 100% paid for, that's the German <br>
way.<br>
 Yeah, that makes me sick but that's how it is...so I think we are looking at <br>
an<br>
end of March move in...time and money will tell.  All of the big costs will be<br>
covered by the end of the year, the only thing left is the finishing stuff,<br>
marble, tile, wood floors, stairs, paint, wallpaper...hopefully only a few<br>
hundred thousand more of cash, hopefully!<br>
<br>
I Just left the building and I LOVE IT!  They put the windows in the office,<br>
workers break room, warehouse, and our personal garage...I love them, and <br>
that's<br>
a great relief, I had NO idea how they were going to look, the german way is<br>
custom for each window and NO examples...I told Armin what I wanted and he did<br>
good!<br>
<br>
I could just stay there for hours looking at it all!  Can't wait until you can<br>
come visit!<br>

From the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001)<br>
  Worker dead at desk for 5 days<br>
<br>
  Bosses of a publishing  firm are trying to work out why no one<br>
  noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at<br>
  his desk for FIVE DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling<br>
  okay.  George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a<br>
  proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack<br>
  in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers.  He<br>
  quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until<br>
  Saturday morning when an office cleaner  asked why he was<br>
  still working during the weekend.  His boss Elliot Wachiaski<br>
  said &quot;George was always the first guy in each morning and the<br>
  last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that he was in<br>
  the same position all that time and didn't say anything.  He was<br>
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.  &quot;A post<br>
  mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five<br>
  days after suffering a coronary.  Ironically, George was<br>
  proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.<br>
<br>
  You may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick<br>
  occasionally.<br>

That I am my friend, still smackin' the goods to the company's elite!! <br>
<br>
Didn't ECT go out of bizness a few years back?<br>
<br>
I moved over here last month after much soul searching and a little divine <br>
intervention; I got out while the gettin' was good (and there was still <br>
something to get out of)   Remember, there are no layoffs in the Champagne <br>
Room...<br>
  <br>
So now I'm toiling away on the power desk, Commodity Risk Management to be <br>
exact.  Currently, I take the wholesale curves and massage them to  capture <br>
more of the physical risk associated with the retail bizness (cong., losses, <br>
ancillary etc.)  A commercial role no doubt!!  And last week I learned how to <br>
schedule power in California--take that to the cocktail party and stretch <br>
some honnies yessir!!  i thought the'd never give a brotha the busbar...<br>
<br>
BTW--either you are really early for Easter Bunny decorations, you've <br>
expanded on your rainbow welcome mat, or you are seriuosly remiss about the <br>
Christmas decorations (or worse, a party I missed inviting myself to?!)  <br>
What's up with that?  How is everything else going?    How's Julie these days?<br>
Did you ever get those peppers to grow?  God be willing, I'll have some <br>
chilis, serranos, and habaneros to trade this summer.  Aye Poppeeee!<br>
Anyway, keep in touch, with others that is.<br>

Dear Scott,<br>
<br>
Are you set for Christmas?  Where are you spending the holidays?<br>
<br>
Our roof party went great!  The weather was good, no rain and the sun was out,<br>
it was just a little too windy.  But we were grilling in our private garage,<br>
which is opened only to the North and the wind comes from the West and South.<br>
Every seemed to enjoy the party, lots of beer, sekt, and wine was had by all<br>
(that seemed to warm them all up too)  And most all of the bratw_rst and bread<br>
was eaten!  Angus managed to stay warm and dry until the last 30 minutes.  We<br>
had had a lot of rain, which left a lot of deep mud puddles where the trucks <br>
had<br>
been driving on the land.  He suddenly showed up in the garage totally soaked!<br>
Looks like he jumped and missed the land, landing in a puddle that was like a<br>
lake to him!  I had brought a large thick cloth bag for him, I knew somehow <br>
he'd<br>
manage to be in the mud...so I bagged him up and put him in the truck until we<br>
could get him home and washed.  We now have a Christmas tree on our roof of <br>
our<br>
house...looks neat!<br>
<br>
Friday, we layed sewer pipes (in a drizzling rain) for the rainwater.  It runs<br>
down the gutters then into the pipes buried in the ground, until it reaches <br>
our<br>
huge rainwater reservoir under the warehouse.  (Water is very expensive here,<br>
just for our little garden and apartment, the bill was 2,500 DM for the year.<br>
Soon we will be watering an acre!)  The gutters were working just great too!  <br>
It<br>
was quite a muddy river down in those ditches where we were laying the pipe <br>
with<br>
all the rainwater coming off the roof onto us.<br>
<br>
Well it is finally cold here, REALLY COLD!  Looks like our winter has arrived.<br>
At least most of the windows are in the house, all in the office and <br>
warehouse,<br>
the final tiles should be on the roof be the end of tomorrow (but the roof is<br>
closed with wood) and best of all the HEATING IS WORKING IN THE OFFICE and<br>
breakroom!<br>
<br>
Yesterday we celebrated our one year anniversary for our civil service wedding<br>
by working somemore on our building.  We took bratw_rst, bread and wine and<br>
grilled out in our utility room!  We then dined in the breakroom, while <br>
sitting<br>
on a big bundle of styrofoam in front of the radiator.  It was really nice,<br>
there's actually a great view out that window overlooking the rolling fields<br>
(that are still GREEN!).<br>
<br>
Then for the evening we went to the Christmas market in our town and dined at<br>
the Rathaus (the restaurant acrosse the plaza from the actual Rathaus that we<br>
married in...Rathaus means, government building...Courthouse).  To tell you <br>
the<br>
truth, AÂ mann's is better, but they are closed on Sunday evenings.<br>
<br>
Melissa and family are all set to be here next weekend.  Can't wait to see <br>
them!<br>
 We finally got our tree finished yesterday morning.  Armin was being <br>
extremely<br>
difficult about the lighting on the tree, but he finally got lights (after<br>
buying 4 different sets) that pleased him, so I then decorated.  I have to <br>
admit<br>
he does now have the best possible looking lights, even if the tree had to sit<br>
there for 3 weeks while he searched the stores!<br>
<br>
We hope you have a nice easy week and a great Christmas vacation!  I have a<br>
confession to make, since I have just realized that I have not mailed my<br>
Christmas cards...it looks like I may not get that done this year, please<br>
forgive me!  I hope to do better in the future.  It is still so difficult for <br>
me<br>
to function in this tiny apartment, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE OFFICE AND HOUSE TO <br>
BE<br>
FINISHED!!!!<br>
<br>
Take care!<br>
<br>
Connie, Armin and Angus<br>
<br>

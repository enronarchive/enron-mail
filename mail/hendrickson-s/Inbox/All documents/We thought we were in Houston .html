<div id=msg_body>
We went to dinner with some friends, Udo and Annette, to a new restaurant<br>
here....<br>
The Outback!  It was the same building inside and out as in Houston...even<br>
the same kind of parking lot!  We got there at 6, we had movie tickets for<br>
8, and it was exactly the same as in Houston, an hour wait at the bar!  The<br>
menu was the same and some were in English, some were in Deutsch, we had a<br>
bloomin onion and steaks (they were from Argentina though)  Armin even got<br>
his frozen margarita!  We had a great time, the place was full of Americans.<br>
It was so different from german restaurants.<br>
<br>
We saw a german film afterwards, The Experiment, it was very intense, but<br>
good.  (Scott you would like this one). The theatre was really nice, just<br>
like an American Cineplex.  But the film was in German.  It made us feel<br>
like we were back &quot;home&quot;.<br>
<br>
Hope you all had a good St. Patty's!<br>
C onnie<br>

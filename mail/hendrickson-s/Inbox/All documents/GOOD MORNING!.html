Well, I think there is a light at the end of the tunnel...but not soon enough<br>
for Armin.  I am afraid he is not going to make it to the end of the week, his<br>
parents have him soooo stressed out.  I won't even go into what all they are<br>
doing to him, you wouldn't beleive it!<br>
<br>
Claudia, our housekeeper, is WONDERFUL! She has us all cleaned out and<br>
organized, IT'S GREAT!  I don't have to do a thing, no vacuum, no laundry, no<br>
cleaning, no ironing, nothing!!! AND  she's a great cook!  Right now she's<br>
cooking my favorite...schweinebraten with kloÂ e and sauce!  She makes enough <br>
for<br>
lunch that we can have it in the evening if I don't want to cook.  I am <br>
getting<br>
spoiled rotten and I love it!  She's also very good company, alot of fun.  I<br>
can't wait until we are all at the new building, all moved into the house too.<br>
<br>
The carpet man is at the building now putting down the glue stuff that the<br>
carpet sits on for the office, the carpet comes tomorrow!  Then we can start<br>
putting furniture in!  I have already packed up all the files that I could and<br>
those boxes are in the archive room at the new office.  The phone gets turned<br>
on, on Friday!  I will have a direct number to my desk, I think it's going to <br>
be<br>
991199119, I have 50 to choose from and I think I like that one.  Then for the<br>
private house 991199111.  Armin and Lolo have to program the system this week,<br>
they don't always have alot of luck when they tackle this task...cross your<br>
fingers for them!  Armin needs something to go smoothly for a change.<br>
<br>
Today we received our first payment from a customer!  It's so exciting to<br>
finally make some money from all the work Armin does!  I hope it keeps coming <br>
in<br>
and the stock market keeps going up and the Euro down!  Then we can finish the<br>
house!!!  I still still don't know the date for when that will be, I hope in<br>
another month to know more.  Armin wants to do so much of the work himself <br>
but I<br>
don't know when he has the time. J_rgen, Lolo, Mitch and John all have been<br>
helping him.<br>
<br>
Our highs here are not hitting 30o F.  But at least it's dry, the snow is gone<br>
and there isn't ice on the streets. Have ya'll warmed up there now?   Our<br>
coldest temp this year was like 16oF and I didn#t like that but at least it's<br>
dry.<br>
<br>
Well, Claudia said lunch is ready, so gotta go for now!  I will try to do <br>
better<br>
on my emails I haven#t been sending many lately to anyone!  Hope you are<br>
well!  (Got any gossip???)<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
Connie, Armin and Angus<br>

Well, Armin made it back all in one piece from his ski trip.  He said that<br>
it was a good trip, but the sun didn't shine the whole time.  He said that<br>
the hotel was full of Americans!  And that most of the service people in the<br>
area were either Canadian or American.  They didn't even speak the language,<br>
only english...which is no problem for Armin now.  (The language in<br>
Switzerland is supposed to be german so he was ok either way!)<br>
<br>
He brought back a brochure, but forgot to take the camera.  It looks<br>
beautiful!  We all have to go sometime...even the brochure was in german and<br>
english.  It was just 6 hour drive from here too.  Of course, It was only<br>
like 4 to Austria and I liked it really well and it was cheaper.<br>
<br>
We had a blizzard here while armin was gone. About 1 foot of snow in 24<br>
hours.  Angus and I made a snowman bottom.  We couldn't pick up the second<br>
ball to make a man.  I have never seen snow stick like this did.  I made a<br>
small ball with my hand at the table in the garden and rolled it up to the<br>
door and back (that's like a total of 12 feet)...there was nothing but grass<br>
left where I had rolled it and the ball was bigger than I could reach<br>
around!  I hope that was the last snow of the year!  I'M READY FOR SUMMER<br>
AND VACATION!!!<br>
<br>
Hope you all had a great weekend!<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
Connie, Armin and ANgus<br>

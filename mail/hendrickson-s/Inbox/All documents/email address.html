Yes, the business address is what you should use during your morning hours.<br>
When I go home for dinner each day I check the home one then and then again<br>
normally before bed.  But I am here at the office MUCH more than at home.<br>
We love our office!  We have so much room and it's OURS!<br>
<br>
About the phone number, ISN'T THAT STRANGE?? You can have a number that is 5<br>
digits or alot more!  I don't understand how this system works in Germany.<br>
OUr main number is area code 931 then<br>
991191-0, we then also can have  any number between 991191-10 and 991191-50<br>
in our system.  Our apartment number is only 97753, 5 digits??? Can you<br>
explain it to me?? Armin can't.  But I think all handy's have the same<br>
number of digits, 11 and no area code...i think.  I don't think anyone has a<br>
number with less than 5 digits.<br>

After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public <br>
Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially <br>
increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by <br>
exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship <br>
marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial <br>
teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. <br>
<br>
To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry <br>
Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be <br>
open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a <br>
world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of <br>
our &amp;Ode to Why8 commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. <br>
With this exhibition, Gehry,s evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his <br>
inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but <br>
his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined <br>
his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with <br>
this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, <br>
as we strive to be the &quot;Leading Company in the World.&quot;<br>
<br>
All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an <br>
Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit <br>

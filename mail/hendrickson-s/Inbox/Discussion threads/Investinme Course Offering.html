rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals <br>
contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with <br>
insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work <br>
that goes into putting one together.<br>
<br>
When you leave the program, you will have:<br>
<br>
R An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to <br>
Enron's transactions.<br>
R A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the &quot;deal space&quot; and <br>
how the financial principals discussed  relate to  Enron deals.<br>
R The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron <br>
deal.<br>

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the <br>
Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of <br>
MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and <br>
outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each <br>
message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and <br>
inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following <br>
attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, <br>
*.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these <br>
e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how <br>
to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.<br>
<br>
We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful <br>
e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down <br>
time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or <br>
malicious code.<br>

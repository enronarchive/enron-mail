 Organization Announcement (Correction) <br>
<br>
I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had <br>
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not <br>
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided <br>
below. <br>
<br>
 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. <br>
EH&amp;S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  <br>
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year <br>
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas <br>
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive <br>
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, <br>
please welcome Ken in his new role.<br>
<br>
Henry  Van<br>

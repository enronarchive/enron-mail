Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate <br>
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the <br>
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups <br>
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market <br>
opportunities.<br>
<br>
With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk <br>
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, <br>
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and <br>
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these <br>
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice <br>
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the <br>
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will <br>
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice <br>
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the <br>
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim <br>
Belden.<br>
<br>
These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while <br>
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading <br>
organizations.<br>
<br>
These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don <br>
on their new roles.<br>
<br>
<br>

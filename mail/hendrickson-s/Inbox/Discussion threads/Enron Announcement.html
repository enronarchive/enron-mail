Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers<br>
<br>
Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:<br>
<br>
National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  <br>
<br>
The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total <br>
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing <br>
provisions (i.e. insurance).<br>
<br>
National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value <br>
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first <br>
choice for Enron travelers' needs.<br>
<br>
Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract <br>
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and <br>
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, <br>
where available.<br>
<br>
When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or <br>
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate <br>
selected: <br>
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or <br>
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for <br>
any damage to it. <br>
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. <br>
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 <br>
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. <br>
** IMPORTANT ***<br>
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following <br>
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded <br>
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)<br>
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's <br>
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in <br>
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club <br>
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the <br>
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid <br>
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron <br>
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron <br>
American Express T&amp;E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on <br>
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com &lt;http://gss.enron.com/&gt;.<br>

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.<br>
 <br>
Kidsave,s  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to <br>
travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The <br>
program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting <br>
an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, <br>
fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an <br>
opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of <br>
adopting an older  child.<br>
 <br>
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - <br>
96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 <br>
percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through <br>
the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.<br>
 <br>
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing <br>
all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent <br>
families or  family-like environments.<br>
 <br>
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to <br>
help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a <br>
non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to <br>
bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at <br>
281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston,s  Kidsave <br>
program.   <br>

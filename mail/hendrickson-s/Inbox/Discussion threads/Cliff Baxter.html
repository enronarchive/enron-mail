It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning <br>
as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff,s primary reason <br>
for resigning is to spend more time with his family.<br>
<br>
Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and <br>
straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his <br>
career.  He will be missed.<br>
<br>
Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron,<br>
s wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served <br>
in a variety of positions in Enron,s wholesale businesses, culminating in his <br>
appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in <br>
1999.<br>
<br>
We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for <br>
the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset <br>
dispositions.<br>
<br>
Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in <br>
wishing him the very best.<br>
<br>

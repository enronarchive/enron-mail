It was so good to get your email and to hear that you are doing &quot;ok&quot;.  I<br>
think that is a GREAT idea about the dogs, if ya'll get back together.  They<br>
would love doggie day care and be soooo tired at night that they would sleep<br>
like logs.<br>
<br>
I am so glad to hear that your parents are traveling.  what a beautiful time<br>
to visit New England..did they drive or fly?<br>
<br>
Things are fine here, the house is coming along now and we talked to a<br>
landscaper about setting up our acre of yard...hopefully that will happen in<br>
the next couple of weeks...WE NEED GRASS THIS YEAR!!!  We spent most of the<br>
weekend with Christina and Mitch, they are transferred back to the states in<br>
a month....we are all depressed about that, they love it here and don't want<br>
to go...but when the military says JUMP, what else can you do???  We all<br>
grilled out Sat with Lolo and family, he has his garten looking soöö fine<br>
(we all are shocked at what he has been capable of...he built a wooden deck,<br>
edged it in stone, filled the whole yard with dirt, planted a full yard of<br>
shrubs, etc...THEN he layed a stone driveway and walk way...IT'S<br>
BEAUTIFUL!!!<br>
<br>
Then on Sun Christina, Mitch and us went to Aßmanns for lunch and started<br>
having aperitiffs..they were so good and we were IN THE MOOD..so we had<br>
more, then Herr Aßmann treated us all to our favorite schnapps!  We were<br>
feeling good by the time we left to go to our building and have MARGARITA'S<br>
AND WINE!!! After sunning and drinking all day we feasted on a fleisch<br>
dinner...that was all we had here to eat, so we grilled bauchfleisch, steaks<br>
and bratwürst...WE ATE SOOO MUCH, but we had DRANK SO MUCH THAT WE NEEDED<br>
IT, good greasy stuff.  They left about 8pm and we went home to bed.  GREAT<br>
DAY!  Wish so bad you could've been here!!!!<br>
<br>
Today I worked all morning in the office, went home for lunch and we ate<br>
outside on the terrace, then came back to the office and slept in my lounge<br>
chair (with Angus in my lap) until Claudia woke me at 4 pm!  Just in time<br>
for an appointment I had with one of our vendors over some bills.  the<br>
appointment went well, we went home for dinner that Claudia made and now we<br>
are back here at the office.  Armin has a bid to get out and Angus needed to<br>
walk and visit with his dog friends, since he slept alllll afternoon!<br>
<br>
Well, Armin says he's getting finished, so I better go water my flowers<br>
outside before he's ready to head home...write me, write me...WRITE ME!!!<br>

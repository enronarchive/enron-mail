Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of <br>
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, <br>

toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing <br>
human being. <br>

About Coppelia<br>
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de <br>
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o <br>
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving <br>
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early <br>
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the <br>
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, <br>
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as <br>
follows: &quot;Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. <br>
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its <br>
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's <br>
prologue.&quot;<br>
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a <br>
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), <br>
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet <br>
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet <br>
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking <br>
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, &quot;It would <br>
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking <br>
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and <br>
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater <br>
stage.&quot;    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)<br>
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the <br>
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on <br>
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the <br>
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the <br>
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a <br>
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with <br>
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a <br>
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the <br>
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the <br>
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully <br>
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.<br>

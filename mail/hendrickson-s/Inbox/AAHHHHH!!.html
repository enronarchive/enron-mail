I just walked into the kitchen of the new house and a man was putting up a<br>
stone wall????? I went and asked Armin why he was doing that..all the walls<br>
that we need are already there??? He said it's for where the refrigerator<br>
will be later.  WELL we had just decided yesterday to get a side by side and<br>
it would go on a TOTALLY different wall!  Armin is obviously confused from<br>
overwork!  He had the man tear it down, thank god it was still wet cemet.<br>
He's making me VERY Nervous.<br>
<br>
So what's planned for the weekend?  We have a 3 day one, holiday on Monday.<br>
We're having our good by americans party tomorrow here at the<br>
building...it's so sad to see them all go.<br>
<br>
Today is ISOLDE's birthday (armin's mom) I'm not going there though..I think<br>
I will just stay here and drink a glass of wine, you know...one I can enjoy<br>
BECAUSE I AM NOT having to spend time with her.<br>
<br>
WRITE ME!<br>

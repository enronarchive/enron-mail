THAT'S GREAT! I'm so proud of you...to want to go out and start making new<br>
friends and contacts after a breakup is SO HARD!  You have a really great<br>
attitude about all this and I know it must be incredibly hard!  It's so easy<br>
to want to stay home and wait for the phone to ring...and so many times, it<br>
doesn't.  Happy people attract other happy people.  Keep your chin up and<br>
come visit us as soon as you can.<br>
<br>
Armin has already met with the sprinkler people...so I think the grass (when<br>
we plant it...Armin just told me it may be too late for this summer) will do<br>
ok.  they have some really weird ideas about growing grass here???? But they<br>
have alot of weird ideas about alot of things!!!<br>
<br>
Please keep me posted about your mom and give her our best.  We think of her<br>
daily, it's a huge challenge that she and your family have before them.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow is a holiday...don#t know what holiday but some kind...so I think I<br>
will open a bottle of wine for the boss and me, it's 6:30 pm and we can<br>
sleep late...maybe to even 8 in the morning!   Problem is...I don't know<br>
where he went, someone rang the office doorbell and he disappeared...that#s<br>
the problem with this place...IT'S TOO BIG!  Angus and I run ourselves to<br>
death trying to find each other!  Well, I just saw the landscaper's car<br>
drive away, so maybe Armin will come back now....gotta open some wine!<br>
<br>
Write me!<br>

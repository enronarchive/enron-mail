     1. For sauce, in a small saucepan combine garlic or onion, catsup,  steak sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, cooking oil, vinegar, and hot  pepper sauce. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 5  minutes. Remove from heat; set aside.      2. In  a medium mixing bowl combine ground beef, salt, and pepper; mix well.  Shape meat mixture into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.  3. To Cook by Indirect  Grill Method: In a covered grill arrange preheated coals around a  drip pan. Test for medium heat above the pan. Place meat on the  grill rack over the drip pan. Cover and grill for 20 to 24 minutes or  until no pink remains, turning once halfway through grilling time and  brushing frequently with sauce during the last 5 minutes of grilling.  4. To Cook by Direct  Grill Method: Grill meat on the grill rack of an uncovered grill directly  over medium coals for 14 to 18 minutes or until no pink remains,  turning once halfway through grilling time and brushing frequently with  sauce.  5. To  serve, split and toast the buns on the grill. Serve patties in buns with  cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, and pickle, if desired. Makes 4 servings.  Make-Ahead Tip:  Prepare sauce; cover and chill up to 24 hours. Prepare and shape burgers.  Cover with plastic wrap and chill up to 2 hours before grilling.

Dear MR. Hendrickson,<br>
<br>
We're Changing to Serve You Better<br>
<br>
Next Wednesday evening, May 30, 2001, we are launching a new version of eService<br>
Online, the web reservations system on continental.com.  Once the new version is<br>
implemented, you will have access to new options and personalized features<br>
tailored to meet your travel needs. In order to make this transition, we ask<br>
that you carefully review and follow the suggestions listed below.<br>
<br>
Here's What You Need To Know:<br>
<br>
Your Profile<br>
Your profile information, including your username (shendri) and password, has<br>
been transferred to the new version of eService Online. To protect your personal<br>
information, credit card information has not been transferred. You will need to<br>
update your profile.<br>
<br>
Your Itineraries<br>
Information in your Saved Itineraries created on or before May 30 will not be<br>
transitioned.  If you want to keep a copy for your records, print them prior to<br>
6 p.m. CDT, May 30. This change does not affect the status of any reservations<br>
and tickets, just your ability to view them in the new eService Online.<br>
<br>
Signing In<br>
To enhance security, you will have to sign in for each transaction session to<br>
reserve and purchase flights. This means you will have to use your password each<br>
time. To have your password e-mailed to you visit<br>
http://airmail.continental.com/cgi-bin5/flo?y=eD5l0EBYs0BUj0lrr0Am<br>
You are strongly encouraged to sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging<br>
process.<br>
<br>
24-Hour Hold Option<br>
To prepare for next Wednesday's release, we will turn off the &quot;Hold for 24<br>
hours&quot; option. The &quot;Hold&quot; option will not be available between May 25 and May<br>
30.<br>
<br>
Here Are Some of the Changes<br>
<br>
More eTicketing<br>
The new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets<br>
(eTickets). We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by<br>
Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West Airlines<br>
(CO2000-2349).<br>
<br>
Aircraft Seat Maps<br>
We rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat<br>
selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating.<br>
<br>
Pricing<br>
The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on your<br>
selection of either &quot;Search By Lowest Fares&quot; or &quot;Search By Schedule.&quot; We also<br>
added a gold star to denote &quot;continental.com promotional fares,&quot; so you know for<br>
certain when you receive a discounted, online-only airfare.<br>
<br>
Customer Service<br>
Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now<br>
handle all support for online inquiries and reservations services.<br>
<br>
While we've made a number of improvements to the overall experience, this new<br>
version may not, on the surface, appear to be significantly different.  These<br>
changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the<br>
future.  We welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  Based on<br>
feedback from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.<br>
<br>
We're confident you will appreciate the changes and improvements and we look<br>
forward to continuing to serve you in the future.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Continental Airlines, Inc.<br>
<br>

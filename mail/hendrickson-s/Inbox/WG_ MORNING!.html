So what's happening today?  Are you involved in ranking stuff, like Kim?<br>
That's all so much fun.  I think Armin and I should have a ranking meeting,<br>
he would get some low marks in the courteous office behavior..when he gets<br>
stressed he turns into...ISOLDE!!!! Maybe if I threaten his bonus he would<br>
work to improve that one little imperfection.  And of course I need no<br>
improvement in ANY catagory, I'm just perfect (I'm sure he will agree..ha ha<br>
haaaa).  Angus would get the best rating from both of us, he is perfect in<br>
our eyes.<br>
<br>
I think Angus may be in trouble with the workers though...i let him out to<br>
do his business while ago and the workers had their lunches sitting out, I'm<br>
afraid to ask them if he helped himself to their food...he's really bad<br>
about that!  He got on my desk one afternoon while Armin and I were outside<br>
and dined on some M&amp;M's that were in a cup on my desk...there were only like<br>
5 in the cup and when we came back in, I found one partially licked one on<br>
my desk and one on Armin's...of course he was sick that night.<br>
<br>
We are finally getting warmer wetter again, oops that's weather in english.<br>
I was able to take off my coat at lunch time, hopefully tomorrow the<br>
thermals can go too.  I hope Julie has been having better weather in<br>
Prague...but I think not.  Have ya'll heard from her?  I thought she might<br>
call us since she's on the continent...<br>
<br>
Did you tell her about talking to your parents?  She told me that she told<br>
you her secret.  Were you surprised?  I actually guess who it was, but I was<br>
surprised!  Last I heard she didn't know their status....did she ever find<br>
out?<br>
<br>
Well, write me!!!!<br>

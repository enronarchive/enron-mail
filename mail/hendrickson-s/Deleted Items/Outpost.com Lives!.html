Dear Outpost.com customer,<br>
<br>
As you may recall, I sent you an email about five weeks ago about the<br>
tough times for dot-com companies and the tough times we were<br>
experiencing here at Outpost.com. Amazingly, about 7,000 of you sent<br>
us, well, they were pretty close to love letters, in response. Today<br>
I am thrilled to be able to tell you that it now appears that, like<br>
The Rolling Stones, we will indeed be here forever.<br>
<br>
We have just announced that our friends at PC Connection have agreed<br>
to acquire your favorite company, Outpost.com. The best part is that<br>
we will remain Outpost.com and we will remain in our gorgeous<br>
headquarters town of Kent, Connecticut. Thus, we will continue to do<br>
business with you as we always have, with a deep commitment to you,<br>
our customers, with our rather healthy sense of humor, and with the<br>
enormous resources that will now be available to us through the PC<br>
Connection family. And yes, the gerbil stays. We wouldn't have it any<br>
other way.<br>
<br>
The most immediate impact this will have on our business is that,<br>
effective immediately, we have access to tens of millions of dollars<br>
of inventory on a daily basis. This will help us speed your orders on<br>
their way to you much sooner. The gerbil brought in some of his<br>
buddies to work in the warehouse, so we now have many more hands<br>
(paws?) available there as well.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, we are awfully excited about this. PC Connection is<br>
a company we have long admired, and to say that this is a good fit is<br>
quite an understatement. So, the bottom line is that you are stuck<br>
with us. We just won't go away and we plan on finding new and even<br>
more clever ways to entertain you as you shop for a very long time to<br>
come. As a matter of fact, we would really appreciate it if you could<br>
help us name this silly gerbil as we are all getting tired of calling<br>
him, &quot;Gerbil&quot;. You can do this at:<br>

<br>
Thanks again for all your support over the past six years. It has<br>
been an honor serving you and getting to know you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Darryl Peck<br>
Founder, CEO &amp; President<br>
Outpost.com (forever, really!)<br>

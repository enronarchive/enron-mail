&gt; REVIEW: 'MOULIN ROUGE' DAZZLING, ELECTRIFYING<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is, quite simply, a spectacular reinvention of the movie<br>
musical. It's a movie full of color, and song, and a lot of panache. All that<br>
style doesn't always work -- and at times things get too frantic and the<br>
editing becomes too fragmented -- but as a whole this ambitious project flies<br>
off the screen.<br>

&gt; REVIEW: 'WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?' YES, IT IS<br>
<br>
<br>
The title of Martin Lawrence's new picture, &quot;What's the Worst That Could<br>
Happen?&quot;, is meant as a rhetorical question. But it only takes about 10 minutes<br>
of Lawrence lumbering around in especially heavy-lidded, thick-tongued style<br>
before the unavoidable answer strikes you: The worst that could happen is this<br>
crummy movie.<br>

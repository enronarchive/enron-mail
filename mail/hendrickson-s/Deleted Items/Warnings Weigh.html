Good evening!<br>
Here is your Money Mail for Wednesday, June 6.<br>
<br>
BUZZ AT THE BELL<br>
A day after upbeat profit forecasts lifted stocks, a couple<br>
of earnings warnings knocked them back down. J.P. Morgan<br>
Chase and Hewlett-Packard -- two members of the Dow Jones<br>
industrials -- both projected difficult business conditions<br>
in the quarters ahead.<br>
<br>
J.P Morgan Chase fell 3.4 percent after warning of lower<br>
trading revenue, and H-P shares dipped 4.5 percent after<br>
the company said the global technology slowdown could<br>
persist for some time. Other financial and computer stocks<br>
fell in sympathy.<br>
<br>
Their losses helped drag the Dow down 106, or 0.9 percent,<br>
to 11,070. More broadly, the Nasdaq Composite fell 16 to<br>
2,218 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 14 to 1,270.<br>
<br>
Energy stocks lost ground thanks to news that U.S.<br>
inventories of crude oil and gasoline rose sharply in the<br>
latest week. The weekly update from the American Petroleum<br>
Institute showed a 3.4-million-barrel increase in crude<br>
stocks and led prices of both gas and oil lower.<br>
<br>
Exxon-Mobil shares fell 2.3 percent to 89.40, accounting<br>
for about 13 Dow index points. Oil drillers, natural-gas<br>
producers and refiners all saw their share prices decline.<br>
<br>
Fewer than a third of S&amp;P industry groups posted gains<br>
Wednesday, and those that rose generally advanced 2 percent<br>
or less. Health care companies, defense stocks,<br>
consumer-products makers and electronics retailers did best.<br>

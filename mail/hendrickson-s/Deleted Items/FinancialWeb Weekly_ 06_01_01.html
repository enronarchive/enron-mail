1. LOOKING FORWARD<br>
Our Take: Waiting Period<br>
<br>
Economic and Market Outlook:<br>
<br>
Two months of upswing and hesitation has crept back into the markets.  Analysts are busy downgrading sectors and stocks, stating that prices have risen too much - unsupported by the fundamentals. It is true that  industry problems are too deep rooted to be miraculously solved overnight.  The markets' rise is more likely due to a change in investor sentiment - an attitude of &quot;enough is enough&quot; - rather than an elimination of the problems.<br>
<br>
However, it is also true that recovery is on its way. Inventories are  improving and  rate cuts are  spurring consumer spending. The production lines will start rolling again. The only hitch is a lengthy wait for consumer demand to translate into capital spending and a resolution of  overcapacity. The Fed is doing its best: patience is the name of the game. Till then, volatility in the market is inevitable.<br>
<br>
Economic data expected next week includes factory orders, construction spending, NAPM services index, wholesale inventories and consumer credit.<br>

Earnings Outlook:<br>
<br>
There is still a month before earnings season, but warnings season has begun. If the latest warnings are any sample of what has yet to come, investors have a right to be wary.<br>

IPO Outlook:<br>
<br>

2. LAST WEEK<br>
<br>
Economic and Market Update:<br>
<br>
Following a lackluster Friday, even the Memorial Day holiday weekend  couldn't revitalize the bulls. Stocks headed steadily downward until Tuesday evening, troubled by earnings warnings, analyst downgrades and acquisition news. Tech stocks were worst hit. Wednesday was, however, a different story - investors flocked back to the stock market to buy anything from tech to Old Economy.<br>
<br>
Networking, semiconductor, fiber-optic, software and Internet stocks were hurt most in the tech sector. Other sectors that took a beating were utilities, biotech, retail and finance. Sectors that showed strength for the first half of the week included drug, medical, insurance, chemical and paper stocks.<br>
<br>
On the economic front, consumer confidence rose to 115.5 in May from a revised 109.9 in April. Aggressive rate cuts by the Fed and renewed strength in the stock markets have boosted the spirits of consumers. This infused hope that consumer spending may rebound.<br>
<br>
Personal income and spending figures showed that U.S. personal spending rose faster than income. Income rose 0.3%, while spending rose 0.4% in April, in synch with analyst estimates. Weekly jobless claims rose yet again - to 419,000 last week from 407,000 the prior week.<br>

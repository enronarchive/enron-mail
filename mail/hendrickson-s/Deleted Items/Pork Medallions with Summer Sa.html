[IMAGE]     8 boneless  pork loin chops, cut 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inches thick (America's Cut)    1/4 cup lime  juice   1/4 cup Worcestershire  sauce   1/4 cup coarse-grain  brown mustard or Dijon-style mustard   3 tablespoons  vinegar              2 tablespoons  water   1-1/2 teaspoons  ground cumin   1/4 teaspoon  salt   1/8 teaspoon  pepper   1 recipe  Summer Salsa (see below)    		<br>
		<br>
     1. Place the pork loin chops in a clean, heavy plastic bag. Set  the bag in a large bowl. Combine the lime juice, Worcestershire sauce,  mustard, vinegar, water, cumin, salt, and pepper. Pour over the pork in  bag; seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or  up to 24 hours, turning occasionally.     2.   Remove the pork from the bag, reserving marinade. Grill* pork on an uncovered  grill directly over medium coals for 20 to 30 minutes or until thermometer  registers 160 degrees F., juices run clear, and meat is slightly pink  in center; halfway through cooking turn and brush with marinade. Serve  with Summer Salsa. Makes 8 servings.   *To broil: Place pork  on unheated rack of a broiler pan. Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for 22  to 24 minutes or until thermometer registers 160 degrees F. and juices  run clear, turning once halfway through cooking and brushing with marinade.    Summer  Salsa: In  a medium mixing bowl combine 1-1/2 cups chopped fresh apricots or peeled  peaches; 3/4 cup chopped red or green sweet pepper; 3/4 cup chopped, seeded  cucumber; 1/4 cup sliced green onion; 1 to 2 jalapeno peppers**, seeded  and finely chopped; 2 tablespoons honey; 2 tablespoons lime juice; and  1 tablespoon snipped fresh cilantro or parsley. Cover; chill for up to  4 hours, stirring once or twice. Serve with a slotted spoon. Makes about  2-1/2 cups salsa.   **Note:  Because hot chile peppers contain volatile oils that can burn your eyes,  lips, and skin, avoid direct contact with them as much as possible. When  working with chili peppers, cover your hands with plastic bags (or wear  plastic or rubber gloves). Be sure to wash your hands well with soap and  water before touching your eyes or face.

Good evening!<br>
Here is your Money Mail for Friday, June 1.<br>
<br>
BUZZ AT THE BELL<br>
Confused investors staged a two-act play Friday.<br>
<br>
First, they scrambled to react to confusing reports on<br>
labor conditions and manufacturing. U.S. companies cut<br>
fewer jobs last month than anticipated while activity at<br>
factories slumped further. The manufacturing figures are<br>
roughly in line with other recent factory readings, but the<br>
jobs release is a head-scratcher -- and that's why major<br>
indexes bounced up and down in a tight range much of<br>
Friday.<br>
<br>
But sometime after lunch, investors began to bid up key<br>
stocks and the major indexes followed.<br>
<br>
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 78 points at<br>
10,990. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 39 to close out<br>
the week at 2149. The S&amp;P 500 ended up 5 at 1261.<br>
<br>
Optimism has resurfaced that perhaps the worst is over for<br>
technology stocks. Intel, Microsoft and Oracle advanced.<br>
Novellus and Flextronics affirmed that their earnings would<br>
fulfill current expectations, and shares of both companies<br>
jumped more than 5 percent. (Sometimes &quot;poor visibility&quot;<br>
turns out okay. Just keep your guard up -- second-quarter<br>
confessionals are starting to roll in.)<br>
<br>
Perhaps short-term money should head for the beach and<br>
leave stock picking to the folks looking ahead six to 12<br>
months, or longer. Surely there are bargains ready to pop,<br>
but finding them has never been tougher.<br>

SCOUTING REPORT: MONDAY<br>
<br>
Next week's calendar is devoid of economic reports that<br>
will matter five minutes after they hit the tape.<br>
Amazon.com talks to analysts on Tuesday -- keep an eye on<br>
that. And look for a little craziness in small-caps in<br>
coming days. The Russell 2000 index gets its annual reset<br>
on July 1, based on market caps as of May 31. Could be a<br>
little scramble to front-run the indexed fund managers who<br>
have to buy the new kids on the block.<br>
<br>
STOCKS<br>
* Amazon's Jungle of Debt, More Upside Seen in Drillers *<br>
Amazon meets with analysts on Tuesday. Can it explain its<br>
balance sheet?<br>

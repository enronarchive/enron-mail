Ladies and Gentlemen:<br>
<br>
The Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) is seeking comments, from<br>
all interested parties, on proposed OASIS Business Practices and issues<br>
related to OASIS Phase II.<br>
<br>
The ESC's goal is to file with the FERC, the &quot;Standardized&quot; Business<br>
Practices that are necessary to support the implementation of OASIS<br>
Phase II as required by the FERC ANOPR {Docket No. RM00-10-000}.  These<br>
standardized business practices will be filed with the FERC on August<br>
31, 2001.<br>
<br>
This summer, the ESC will conduct three rounds of public comment<br>
postings.  This is the first posting and will run from May 25 through<br>
June 11.  The ESC will compile, and respond in general, to the comments.<br>
The ESC responses to the comments will be posted, with revisions to the<br>
documents, at the next round of public postings.  The next two postings<br>
are tentatively scheduled for June 26, 2001 and July 31, 2001.<br>
<br>
The above referenced documents are available for review, and comment, on<br>
the NERC web site: www.nerc.com &lt;http://www.nerc.com&gt;.  From NERC Fast<br>
Links, select OASIS Phase II Business Issues. Please read the Business<br>
Issues Summary document before commenting.  Comments will only be<br>
accepted on the comment form provided.<br>

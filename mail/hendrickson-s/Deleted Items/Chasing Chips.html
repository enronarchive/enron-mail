Good evening!<br>
Here is your Money Mail for Thursday, June 7.<br>
<br>
BUZZ AT THE BELL<br>
The vagaries of semiconductor supply and demand once again<br>
drove stock trading -- this time to the delight of<br>
chip-stock investors. Thanks to a positive profit spin from<br>
National Semiconductor, stocks of companies that make chips<br>
and chip equipment soared.<br>
<br>
The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.1 percent, climbing 46 to<br>
2,264. The Dow Jones industrials and Standard &amp; Poor's 500<br>
closed fractionally higher.<br>
<br>
But shares in the semiconductor sector jumped more than 6<br>
percent after National Semi, despite reporting a quarterly<br>
loss, projected better sales in the months ahead. The chip<br>
maker pointed out that its clients' semiconductor<br>
inventories have plummeted, suggesting they'll need to bump<br>
up their orders sometime soon. National Semi shares surged<br>
11 percent to 31.04, while sector heavyweight Intel climbed<br>
4.5 percent and Applied Micro Devices rose 6.7 percent.<br>
<br>
Chip makers' gains spread cheer to other corners of the<br>
technology arena. Computer networkers jumped 5 percent,<br>
propelled by a 5.1-percent gain in Cisco shares, and makers<br>
of electronic instruments rose 3.3 percent.<br>
<br>
About half of S&amp;P industry groups advanced. Among the<br>
biggest decliners were tobacco stocks, defense contractors<br>
and photo-imaging companies. Shares of the most widely held<br>
companies generally rose, except for modest declines in<br>
International Business Machines, AOL TimeWarner, and<br>
Citigroup. Overall trading volume was light.<br>

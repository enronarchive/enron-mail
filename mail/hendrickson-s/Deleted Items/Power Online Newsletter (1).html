Certified and tested to 500 lb. load capacity, constructed of non-conductive fiberglass side rails for protection from electrical circuits and more. -- Carbis, Inc., Florence, SC<br>
http://www.poweronline.com/read/nl20010601/433146<br>
<br>
2) Alkalinity (hydrate)<br>

Boiler operators must maintain relatively high hydrate alkalinity levels when phosphate cycle treatments are used to ensure the formation of softer, more easily removable deposits. This specific test for hydrate alkalinity provides a more accurate value than the calculation method used by most operators. -- CHEMetrics, Inc., Calverton, VA<br>

     1. Cut off and discard upper stalks from fennel bulbs. Remove  tough outer layer of bulbs; cut off a thin slice from base. Cut fennel  bulbs into thin wedges.      2.   In a covered large pot cook new potatoes in boiling, lightly salted water  for 7 minutes; add fennel wedges and squash slices. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes  more or until potatoes are just tender and fennel is crisp-tender; drain  vegetables well. Let cool about 1 hour.  3. In a screw-top  jar combine oil, lemon juice, mustard, sugar, garlic, salt, and pepper.  Cover and shake well. Add to potato mixture along with green onion; gently  toss to combine. Cover and chill in refrigerator for at least 3 hours.  4. Serve potato  salad on a bed of fresh watercress, curly endive, or other greens, if  desired. Makes 12 side-dish servings.

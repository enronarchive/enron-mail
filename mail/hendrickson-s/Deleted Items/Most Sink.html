Good evening!<br>
Here is your Money Mail for Wednesday, May 30.<br>
<br>
BUZZ AT THE BELL<br>
Technology stocks, including Sun Microsystems, led most<br>
other stocks on a mass march to the downside on Wednesday.<br>
Profit warnings, coupled with thin trading and a lack of<br>
buyers, caused most industry groups and shares to decline.<br>
<br>
Investors are beginning to question the widely held view<br>
that economic growth and corporate profits are poised to<br>
rebound by the second half of this year, analysts say.<br>
<br>
The Nasdaq Composite Index ended down 91 points, or 4.2<br>
percent, to 2085. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index fell 20<br>
points, or 1.6 percent, to 1248. The Dow Jones industrial<br>
average lost 167, or 1.5 percent, to 10,872.<br>
<br>
The focal point of the trading day was Sun.<br>
<br>
Sun closed down 13.8 percent at 16.10. The maker of<br>
computer servers warned that its earnings in its fourth<br>
quarter will be less than previously expected. It said<br>
customers are buying less than anticipated, citing Europe<br>
as particularly weak. The news hurt other tech companies.<br>
Cisco, Oracle, IBM, and others also fell.<br>
<br>
The most troubling aspect of the sell off was it touched<br>
almost every corner of the market. Energy was the only<br>
major industry group that managed to post a gain, which was<br>
minimal.<br>
<br>
Some analysts say investors should take the long-term view<br>
when investing this summer.<br>

SCOUTING REPORT: THURSDAY<br>
The long wait for marguee economic data continues Thursday.<br>
With the May jobs report looming on Friday, the help-wanted<br>
index and Chicago purchasing managers' index should have<br>
little impact. Earnings are nearly done but early warnings<br>
are possible from here on out. In thin trading, funny<br>
things can happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
STOCKS<br>
* What's Next for Microsoft? *<br>
Some analysts say Microsoft is near a top. Others see even<br>
better days ahead.<br>

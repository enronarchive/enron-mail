Good evening!<br>
Here is your Money Mail for Monday, June 4.<br>
<br>
BUZZ AT THE BELL<br>
Stocks shuffled aimlessly Monday in quiet trading,<br>
eventually closing slightly higher across the board.<br>
Neither a healthy inflation outlook from the Federal<br>
Reserve chairman nor a bleak semiconductor sales report<br>
seemed to excite investors.<br>
<br>
Blue chips sported the biggest gains as the Dow Jones<br>
industrial average rose a whopping 0.6 percent, gaining 71<br>
points to 11,062. The Nasdaq Composite edged up 7 to 2,156<br>
and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 6 to 1,267.<br>
<br>
Overnight, Fed chief Alan Greenspan told a Singapore<br>
monetary-policy conference that U.S. inflation is under<br>
control, at least as far as consumers are concerned.<br>
Normally, that would be something to shout about. But<br>
Greenspan blunted any optimistic response by pointing out<br>
the reason inflation remains at bay: In order to fend off<br>
competition and keep you and me as customers, companies are<br>
accepting slimmer profit margins instead of raising prices.<br>
<br>
Greenspan's comments inspired an early pop that quickly<br>
fizzled.<br>
<br>
The other big piece of before-the-bell news -- the<br>
Semiconductor Industry Association's April sales report --<br>
exerted a more lasting influence, but only on chip stocks.<br>
The SIA said chip sales slumped 4.7 percent in April from<br>
March. In response, producers of both chips and chip-making<br>
equipment lost ground. Applied Micro Devices fell more than<br>
6 percent and Applied Materials lost about 2.5 percent.<br>
Industry giant Intel was little changed, while shares of<br>
Cypress Semiconductor actually rose, despite the company's<br>
profit warning.<br>
<br>
Oil-related shares rose as crude prices bubbled higher,<br>
this time in response to more threats of supply disruption<br>
from Iraq. The S&amp;P oil-drilling group climbed 2.3 percent,<br>
while the more diversified oil-and-gas group rose 1.5<br>
percent. Triton Energy, meanwhile, surged more than 15<br>
percent after the company announced a huge oilfield<br>
discovery off the African coast.<br>
<br>
More broadly, about two-thirds of S&amp;P industry groups<br>
tallied gains, although nothing moved particularly fast or<br>
far.<br>

SCOUTING REPORT: TUESDAY<br>
Late spring can feel an awful lot like summer. A light<br>
economic calendar and slow trickle of earnings reports<br>
could spell -- say it with me -- quiet trading. Of course,<br>
making that prediction leaves one vulnerable to all sorts<br>
of surprises. So tomorrow looks slow, but that could change<br>
with the morning headlines.<br>
<br>
<br>
ECONOMIC CALENDAR:<br>
*April factory orders, forecast: -2.7 percent<br>
*Revised Q1 productivity, forecast: -0.7 percent<br>
<br>
<br>
STOCKS<br>
* AOL Still Spells Growth *<br>
Most analysts like AOL Time Warner's prospects for growing<br>
its bottomline.<br>
http://www.cnbc.com/010604mcreynolds-stocks.html?ReferrerID=MM<br>
<br>
* Pick of the Week: Alliant *<br>
Alliant Techsystems may be the best defense industry stock<br>
to buy now, analysts say.<br>

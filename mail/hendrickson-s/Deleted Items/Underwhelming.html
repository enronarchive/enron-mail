Good evening!<br>
Here is your Money Mail for Thursday, May 31.<br>
<br>
BUZZ AT THE BELL<br>
Bargain hunters made a comeback try today, but all three<br>
major indexes are still down four days out of the past six.<br>
Recall that only a week ago, we toasted the Nasdaq<br>
Composite's sixth straight higher close. That was 200<br>
points ago.<br>
<br>
Investors initially bid stocks sharply higher Thursday,<br>
snapping up shares beaten down in Wednesday's selloff. But<br>
their stamina failed before a serious attempt at last<br>
week's summit could be mounted.<br>
<br>
Only the Nasdaq Composite managed a significant move. It<br>
climbed 26 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,111. The Dow Jones<br>
industrial average rose 39 to 10,912 and the Standard &amp;<br>
Poor's 500 edged up 8 points to 1,256 -- fractional<br>
advances for both.<br>
<br>
One hitch might have been this morning's report on weekly<br>
unemployment claims. The government says initial jobless<br>
filings rose for a third straight week, while a measure of<br>
ongoing claims hit a seven-and-a-half-year high. Stocks<br>
usually brush off these erratic weekly labor figures. But<br>
it's hard to ignore bad news three weeks straight.<br>
<br>
Adding to economic concerns, a survey of Chicago-region<br>
purchasing managers showed factory activity at<br>
recession-esque levels in May. That's another hint recovery<br>
could be further off than any of us would like to think.<br>
<br>
But check your portfolio before you get start feeling too<br>
negative. About two-thirds of S&amp;P 500 stocks rose today,<br>
led by those of cellular-phone companies,<br>
photographic-products firms and health care providers.<br>
<br>
Among the biggest losers were publishers, insurance<br>
brokers, restaurants and precious-metals miners.<br>

SCOUTING REPORT: FRIDAY<br>
Brace yourself for some bad news. Those weekly jobless<br>
claims figures that have been sliding of late are about to<br>
get backed up by another weak monthly employment report.<br>
Forecasters think the economy lost about 90,000 jobs in<br>
May, and they expect the unemployment rate to tick up to<br>
4.6 percent. These numbers probably are priced into the<br>
market already, so don't expect the bottom to fall out --<br>
unless the forecasts prove optimistic.<br>
<br>
ECONOMIC CALENDAR<br>
*Nonfarm payrolls for May, forecast: -90,000.<br>
*Unemployment rate for May, forecast: 4.6 percent.<br>
*Average hourly wage for May, forecast: +0.3 percent.<br>
*NAPM manufacturing index for May, forecast: 43.7.<br>
<br>
STOCKS<br>
* Technical Analysis Mailbag *<br>
Given recent bearish action, the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 could<br>
see more downside.<br>

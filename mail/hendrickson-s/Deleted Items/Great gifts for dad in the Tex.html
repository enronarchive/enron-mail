MEMORIES<br>
&quot;My father coached me in Little League baseball, he was a member of the<br>
booster club. He was always very involved, and he would come to all the<br>
games in high school and college, no matter where we were playing. He was my<br>
toughest critic, but also my biggest supporter. My fondest memory was during<br>
my sophomore year in college. I went down and worked out at the Phillies<br>
complex in Florida before the Mount Union baseball team went down there for<br>
our spring trip. My father went down and spent the whole week with me. He<br>
loved baseball and to enjoy that atmosphere with him was very meaningful.&quot;<br>
-- Texans Coach Dom Capers on his relationship with his father<br>
<br>
&quot;My dad and I are very different people, and about the only thing we have in<br>
common is our love of sports. He calls me every week, and we talk for about<br>
an hour. Probably 80 percent to 90 percent of what we talk about is<br>
football. Anybody who overhears our conversations must think we're nuts. I'm<br>
looking forward to the Texans playing next year, so my dad and I can start<br>
going to a couple of Texans games a year at Reliant.&quot;<br>

[IMAGE]     3-1/4 to  3-3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 package active dry yeast   2 tablespoons  snipped fresh chives or 1 tablespoon dried chives   1 medium  cucumber, peeled and cut up (1-1/2 cups)   1 teaspoon  snipped fresh dill or 1/2 teaspoon dried dillweed               1/2 cup dairy  sour cream   1/4 cup water    1 tablespoon  sugar   1 teaspoon  salt     		<br>
		<br>
     1. In a large mixing bowl combine 1-1/4 cups of the flour, yeast,  chives, and dill. In a food processor bowl, process cucumber until smooth  (should have 3/4 cup). In a saucepan heat and stir cucumber puree, sour  cream, water, sugar, and salt until warm (120 degree F. to 130 degree  F.). (Mixture will look curdled.) Add to flour mixture. Beat with an electric  mixer on low to medium speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl. Beat on high  speed for 3 minutes more. Using a spoon, stir in as much of the remaining  flour as you can.      2.   Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead in enough of the remaining  flour to make a moderately stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (6 to  8 minutes). Shape into a ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl; turn once  to grease surface. Cover; let rise in a warm place until double (about  45 minutes).  3.   Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover; let  rest 10 minutes. Divide into 12 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball;  arrange in a greased 13x9x2-inch baking pan, allowing space between each  ball. Cover; let rise in a warm place until nearly double (about 30 minutes).  Bake in a 350 degree F oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until light brown.  Serve warm or cool. Makes 12 rolls.  Make-Ahead Tip:  Cool buns completely. Wrap in foil and place in airtight freezer container  or plastic freezer bag; seal, label and freeze up to 1 month. Thaw and  serve at room temperature or reheat foil-wrapped frozen buns in 300 degree  F. oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until warm.

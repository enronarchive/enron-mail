And I'll show you potential winners to help you profit with my newsletter, the Option Advisor.  I'm Bernie Schaeffer. You might have seen me recently on CNBC, Bloomberg TV, CNN's Moneyline or CNNfn.

Although I've been a top trader for over 25 years, I've  been in demand lately...no surprise in this market.   You may be wondering Why Options? For three important reasons:    Leverage: You can achieve percentage gains from your successful options investments that are 5, 10, and even 20 times the gains achieved by stock or mutual fund investors.  	<br>

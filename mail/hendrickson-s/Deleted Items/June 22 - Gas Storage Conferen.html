Is current storage fill giving us <br>
a false sense of security? <br>
It's May. And those AGA storage numbers might have us feeling pretty secure about the future. But a lot can happen in a few short months. Consider these likely scenarios:<br>
This summer hot or hotter than last summer? Predictions abound. <br>
Record number of new gas fired electric generation units on-line this summer, increasing demand and the draw on storage. <br>
Severe drought affecting hydropower, the lowest output in 30 years. <br>
Natural gas supply availability virtually unchanged from last year's levels.                        Fact or fiction?<br>

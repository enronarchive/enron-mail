Dear scott,<br>
<br>
June is the time to celebrate Dads and Grads! We want to remind you that gifts from eVineyard are the perfect choice for both of them.   Of course there's our tasteful selection of more than 5,000 premium wines. Here are just two of our favorites:<br>
<br>
Canoe Ridge 1998 Merlot, Columbia Valley, Washington<br>
This Merlot has soft plum and chocolate flavors, a smooth feel, and an excellent finish.<br>

<br>
Piper Sonoma NV Brut, California<br>
We like this Brut for its crisp and bright character, berry-apple fruit and faint vanilla flavors.<br>

<br>
Maybe the Dads and Grads on your list are adventure-lovers. Open the world of wine exploration to them with our Wine Clubs. Choose from five distinctive clubs, each one a trip around the world without ever leaving home. Wine Odyssey is a fun and easy way to learn about wine by tasting a carefully selected variety of premium imported and domestic labels. Our TasteTour(tm) Wine Course(tm) is a comprehensive education in wine, guided by Chief Wine Officer, Ronn Wiegand. Ronn's expertise provides just the kind of &quot;inside information&quot; to make a wine lover into a connoisseur.<br>

<br>
Impress everyone with your thoughtfulness and include the Insta-pull Wine Operator, the world's fastest corkscrew, with your wine gift. A gentle pull of the handle lifts any cork from its bottle instantly. You'll find many clever gifts like this in eVineyard's collection of unique wine accessories.<br>

<br>
Still stumped? Let them choose for themselves! With eVineyard Gift Certificates, Dads and Grads can handpick their own gifts from everything we offer. Fun for them, easy for you. Let the celebration begin!<br>

Women's golf has a rivalry, but not in the U.S. Open. Karrie Webb proved again<br>

Annika Sorenstam by crushing the field and winning the U.S. Women's Open in a<br>
runaway for the second straight year.<br>

&gt; WOODS STREAKS TO THIRD STRAIGHT MEMORIAL TITLE<br>
<br>
<br>
Any chance Paul Azinger had of beating Tiger Woods had long since faded as the<br>
two walked together down the soggy 17th fairway. There wasn't much to talk<br>
about, but something still needed to be said. Azinger had entered the final<br>
round of the Memorial Tournament with the lead, but was now seven shots behind.<br>
Now, he thought Woods looked almost bored as he romped to his third straight<br>
Memorial win. &quot;I'm sorry I wasn't a better player for you today,&quot; Azinger told<br>
Woods.<br>

While scientists concede they may be far from a cure, today's AIDS drugs &quot;are<br>
nothing short of miraculous,&quot; says Dr. Jim Curran, head of the first government<br>
task force on what was later called AIDS. Diagnosis of AIDS in the 1980s was<br>
most often associated with quick death. It took more than a decade for<br>
scientists to make real progress in prolonging and improving the lives of<br>
people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.<br>

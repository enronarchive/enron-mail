I'm so sad!!!  Mr. Bean and Greta are going to have to move outside.  Rayfael's allergies just can't take them, even if I relegate them to the downstairs bedroom and outside.  It's like he's building up an immunity to the allergy medicine.  He's just miserable anytime he's at the house - obviously, that doesn't help a relationship.  So, starting tonight (?) they are going to move outside.  I'm gonna have to get them one or two (probably one) doghouse.  I'm so depressed about the whole thing.  Rayfael feels bad too, but it's important he not be near death anytime we're together.  He feels like the bad guy.  And I feel like a bad father!!!  I can't bear to think of their cute little faces staring in the french doors wondering what they did wrong!<br>
<br>
I'm getting paid back for all the nasty things I said about Barbara Dillard and her dogs!!!  I want  you to move back and let Mr. Bean and Greta live with you and Angus!!!  Nextdoor!!!  (the house is still for sale! - $269,000 list now, down from $314,000).<br>
<br>
So, will you come back and be my doggies' mommy?  Armin can come, too.<br>
<br>
Write back!<br>
<br>
Scott<br>

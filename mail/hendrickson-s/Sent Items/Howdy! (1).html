Guten Morgen!!!<br>
<br>
How was your weekend?  We had the long Memorial Day weekend here....hahaha!<br>
<br>
Things are fine here.  I just tried to relax this weekend.  Friday night I went to a movie with Rayfael. We saw Angel Eyes with Jennifer Lopez.  It was pretty good.  Saturday, I pretty much just vegged out a good chunk of the day.  Julie and I went to lunch and ran errands.  I went running every day this weekend, too!  I've lost 10 lbs since the big breakup!!!  Down to 145 now, may go for 140 - not sure.  I didn't go out on Saturday because I was just in a mood to stay in.  Sunday, I took care of some stuff around the house.  I wasn't really planning to go out, but one of my new friends, Kevin, called and wanted me to meet him and some other folks out at a bar, so I went at about 9:00.  Well, you know how 1 or 2 drinks always turns into alot more...I ended up staying there pretty late and having a good time.  I crashed at Kevin's house and got back to mine at about 7:00 am.  So all the work I'd done on getting caught up on sleep was ruined!!!  I came home and got right in bed, but the dogs really wouldn't let me sleep much.  I went over to Julie's yesterday to get instructions on taking care of her cats this week.  She leaves Wednesday for Prague and gets back next Thursday.<br>
<br>
Now it's back to work, but it's a short week at least.  I'm getting more and more used to the fact that I'm single now, and even though I'd like me and Rayfael to get back together - it's nothing I'm gonna be able to push, if it happens, it happens.  I really hope it does, but the best thing for me is not to push it.  So, in the meantime, I guess I'm a free agent!  That feels weird...but, oh well.<br>
<br>
Anyway, how are things there?<br>
<br>
Scott<br>

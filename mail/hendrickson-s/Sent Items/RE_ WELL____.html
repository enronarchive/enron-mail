I don't know if you got my email, I sent it to the office.  Here's what it said in case....<br>

Actually, they reacted very well - or at least as well as can be expected.  They were sad, but not horrified or anything.  They respect me and know that it's not a choice.  It was just so weird, because I did not have any agenda or intention on telling them that at that point, we were just talking about stuff (and drinking) and I just told them.  And I told them, you can't be totally surprised by this - and they said no.  They had questioned it before, but had not wanted to offend me by asking.  At the same time, they were holding out hope that it wasn't true.  But now they know.  They didn't really have alot of questions or anything, but were just accepting of it.  I'm very happy to have it off my chest.<br>

Sorry to hear about your stomach!!!  That doesn't sound fun at all.  I had a pretty bad hangover yesterday, because I drank profusely before durning and after the whole outing myself to my parents ordeal.<br>

So, maybe you already read that.  Anyway, is Armin getting alzheimers???  I don't have any big plans for the weekend.  I actually have a couple of dates, but nothing major.  I've made a couple of new friends, so I want to continue to cultivate those sort of relationships...if other types come up that's fine, but I'm not really concentrating on it.  But I had to go out and tell a couple of my new friends about my revelation to my parents.  A couple of them have not done it themselves, so everybody's all proud of me and stuff.  It's kinda funny really.  But it's like the one thing that was always your biggest concern just isn't there anymore.  I hope it was the right thing to do, but I feel like it was.  Hard to say whether it was good or bad for my mom.  But, honesty is the best policy, right?<br>

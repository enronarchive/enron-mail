But I'm super busy in the mornings trading, so I can't write much....I can barely even catch my breath in the mornings!!!  Especially today because I just turned my alarm off for some reason this morning rather than getting up when it went off.  So, I woke up later and made it to work in like 15 minutes....showered, shaved, clothed and all.  But I'm not quite all here.  I had my front door refinished yesterday (which it REALLY needed - and it looks great now!), and I think the fumes all went upstairs to my bedroom and gave me brain damage and made me want to sleep!  I promise I'll write more in a bit after trading slows down....<br>

You know, you have to WRITE emails to GET emails...and I would hardly call<br>
your last two, WRITING..they were just acknowlegements of your existence,<br>
not your normal informative form of communication.<br>
<br>
WELL????<br>

Good luck with the grass!  I can't even get my little yard covered.  Yeah, I'm open to going out with new people.  Just not really pursuing it just yet.  Depends on how long before I really feel the need :).  Actually, I'm more interested in just making some new friends right now.  I've decided I need a few gay friends to hang out with.  That will get me out meeting more people for other stuff too.<br>
<br>
Yeah, mom and dad got back over the weekend.  They had a good time, sounds like they did nothing but shop!  She's been going to MD Anderson for a while now.  In fact they did bloodwork yesterday and she goes in to see the doctor today.  Anyway, that's the scoop from this side of the Atlantic....<br>

Yeah, I think they will finish with the big bulldozer today, then they come<br>
with the little one for the delicate areas...like right in front of my<br>
french windows!!!  It's looking really nice, just need an acrea of grass<br>
now!<br>
<br>
sorry that things have not improved with rayfael...have you considered<br>
getting out and seeing other folks.  I know you don't want too but it would<br>
be good for you and you never know what a little jealousy can do...but I<br>
don't mean Vincent.<br>
<br>
We are having just beautiful weather!  How is it there?  Are your parents<br>
back yet?  when is your mom going to MD Anderson?<br>

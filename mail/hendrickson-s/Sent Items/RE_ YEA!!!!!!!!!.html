That sounds great!  So will they get it all spread in one day?  Sounds like everything is taking shape now!!!<br>
<br>
Not much going on here.  I had dinner with Rayfael last night, it was a little painful, but I survived.  He's so messed up<br>
in the head right now.  :(<br>
<br>
Anyway, nothing too exciting happening here....at least nothing that's gonna cheer you up...<br>

I'M SO EXCITED!!!! They are finally spreading out my land!  There's a HUGE<br>
bulldozer out there and he's moving the dirt where-ever I tell him.  IT'S<br>
GREAT, EARTH SCULPTING (???).  There will be some low levels, some high<br>
levels and then some mounds...I have an acrea of dirt to play with...it's<br>
like a great big sandbox!  I ALWAYS LOVED PLAYING IN THE DIRT!<br>
<br>
And I am getting so excited about having a yard, ALLLLLL OUR OWN!  With no<br>
tenants (Frau Sweetie) looking down at us.  Our only neighbor, that will<br>
actually live on their land hasn't even started building yet.  They gave us<br>
their plans for approval last week and they are building their house around<br>
an atrium like area...so they won't even have any windows this way!<br>
<br>
I needed something uplifting..I just finished calculating how much we pay<br>
annually to the ins. company to be covered for everything....30,000 DM A<br>
YEAR!  ONLY 14,000 is for the business!  I keep hoping that I can find<br>
something to cancel...but no luck yet.<br>
<br>
So what's happening???<br>

I doubt you will get this b4 you get back, but I'll write anyway.  Yes, I had a GREAT weekend, but I was partying way too much!!!  Went out every night from Wednesday to Sunday!!!  I'm paying the price now though.  But I had a really good time and kept very busy :).  I've been two times to your house so far.  Everything seems fine.  I saw Ellie the first time - pigging out on the canned food.  Didn't see Frankie, but I didn't look either.  The weather here has been very hot, but sunny.<br>
<br>
Sounds like Prague is treating you well.  Is it beautiful?  Tell Peggy I'm not spreading myself TOO THIN...but remember, you can never be too thin or too rich!!!  I can't believe the prices.  And if you get me something that costs 20 cents you better get alot of them!!!  HEHEHEHE<br>
<br>
I'll go to your house again on Wednesday before you get back on Thursday.  Sadly, the Tsunami has not been used - although there were opportunities!!!  hehehehe<br>

Hello Scooter,<br>
<br>
Hope you had fun on your three dates this weekend!!!  (you slut!)<br>
<br>
You know I am jealous.  Peggy says not to spread yourself too thin!!!!<br>
<br>
You would not believe how cheap it is here.  Today at the musuem I had a<br>
sandwich, snickers and a cafe latte for $1.50!!!  A three course dinner last<br>
night cost $3.00.<br>
<br>
The bad news is that your gift cost $0.20!!  (ha, ha)  I really haven't bought<br>
it yet.<br>
<br>
Take Care,<br>
<br>
Miss you,<br>
<br>
Julie  :-)<br>

Hey guys-<br>
BASF is still not showing up as legal reviewing even thought Wendi approved on 10/16. Please make sure that this gets on to Tana, so that we can get this ID out ASAP.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

BASF slipped by.  I really thought I had taken care of that one, but I will have it completed this morning.  FYI: sometimes Credit has completed its part and Legal needs to review.  Until PCG flips the status to &quot;Legal Reviewing&quot; the status will still reflect &quot;Credit Reviewing&quot;.  This usually happens intraday, as PCG is diligent about updating the status field.<br>

Wendi,<br>
Just wondering if things are moving ok from credit to legal in the pa database, as I seem to keep running into cps that your comment says credit approved, but the status is still at credit reviewing....<br>
The latest is BASF Corporation. Can you make sure this moves on to legal? Gracias!<br>

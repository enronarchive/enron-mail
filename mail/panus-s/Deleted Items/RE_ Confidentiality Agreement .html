Dear Ms. Panus,<br>
<br>
I have reviewed the Confidentiality Agreement which you supplied with our<br>
in-house legal staff and we have highlighted proposed changes in blue with<br>
reference to the following issues:<br>
<br>
1)  Description of &quot;Representative&quot; was too broad.  We feel accessing<br>
information by employees and officers of Enron's Treasury Department should<br>
be satisfactory for purposes of reviewing the credit.<br>
<br>
2)  We do not see a reason why the information cannot remain confidential<br>
indefinitely.<br>
<br>
3)  Since California Energy Exchange Corporation is the Disclosing Party,<br>
the jurisdiction governing this agreement should be California.<br>
<br>
4)  It is our experience that an Arbitration requirement is not typical for<br>
a Confidentiality Agreement.<br>
<br>
Let me know if the proposed changes are acceptable.  If you could fax back a<br>
signed copy today, I can send financials to you via Federal Express for<br>
delivery to Wendi Lebrocq by tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Thanks and best regards,<br>
<br>

Mr. Wise,<br>
Attached for your review is the form of Confidentiality Agreement which<br>
Enron prefers.  Such Agreement provides more protection for the<br>
Counterparty and limits the Agreement to a term of one year.<br>
<br>
If such Agreement meets with your approval, we will prepare execution<br>
copies.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me via<br>
email or at the number below.<br>

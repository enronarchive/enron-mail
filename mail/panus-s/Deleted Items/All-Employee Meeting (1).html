<div id=msg_body>
The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  <br>
<br>
As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.<br>
<br>
Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video<br>
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at &lt;http://home.enron/employeemeeting&gt;.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.<br>
<br>
Video Teleconferencing<br>

Below is an email from TranAlta Energy Marketing (U.S.) Inc. (&quot;TransAlta&quot;) regarding their merger with Merchant Energy Group of the Americas, Inc. (&quot;MEGA&quot;).  TransAlta is the surviving entity and they propose to assign the existing ISDA Master between ENA and MEGA from MEGA to TransAlta.  ECC has an ISDA Master with TransAlta, but I think it is a different TransAlta entity.  Please review the below and let us know how you want to proceed.<br>

I got a call today from Sterling Cook at Trans Alta in Calgary telling me that they merged with MEGA.  I'm passing this on to you for handling.  Sterling's ph: is 403/267-6991.  I also asked him to give us the phone number of their credit person so our credit person could talk to their credit person.  He mentioned sending us an amendment changing guaranties and thresholds, and I told him we would have to get that approved by Credit.<br>

Hey Steph,<br>
I hope you had a nice weekend.  We were at the grocery when you called and then we had plans to go to the movie later in the day, so I didn't have a chance to call you back.  We saw Amelie.  I loved it.  It makes me yearn for Paris.  I truly love that city.  So romantic.<br>
 <br>
Anyway, not much happening on this end.  Just getting ready for Thanksgiving.  We are doing the orphan thing and going over to our friend Virginia's to feast, drink and watch movies on her new Sony Dream System, alias Wet Dream System according to her.  It should be mellow and relaxing.  What are you doing for the holiday?  Are you getting together with family?<br>
 <br>
So, is Raymond fully recovering and eager to get back to work?  Or has he put on 50 lbs and become a recluse?  I hope he is doing well.<br>
 <br>
Gotta run, but let's do chat soon.<br>
Give my love to the furry boys,<br>

Stephanie,<br>
Have you had a chance to review the amendments?  Our traders are very eager<br>
to trade with Enron NA (and are asking about it several times a day - I'm<br>
sure you know how it goes!).  Please let me know if there is anything I can<br>
do to help expedite the process.  Thanks a bunch.<br>

&gt; I got a call today from Sterling Koch at Trans Alta in Calgary telling<br>
&gt; me that they merged with MEGA.  I'm passing this on to you for<br>
&gt; handling.  Sterling's ph: is 403/267-6991.  I also asked him to give<br>
&gt; us the phone number of their credit person so our credit person could<br>
&gt; talk to their credit person.  He mentioned sending us an amendment<br>
&gt; changing guaranties and thresholds, and I told him we would have to<br>
&gt; get that approved by Credit.<br>

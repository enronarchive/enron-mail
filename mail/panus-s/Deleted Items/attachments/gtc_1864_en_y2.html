<p><font face="Arial">For each Determination Period, on the applicable
Payment Date with respect to (a) a SWAP, (i) if the Floating Amount is

(specified on this Website or if not specified, in U.S. Dollars) without
deduction, setoff or counterclaim via wire transfer in immediately available
funds prior to noon (London Time) on the relevant Payment Date (or if not
a Business Day, on the next Business Day). If amounts are not paid when
due, they shall bear interest compounded daily until paid in full at the
Interest Rate on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed, and on
the basis of a year of 360 days. If the Payment Dates for two or more Derivative
Transactions between the parties fall on the same day in the same currency,
and if each party is required to make a payment to the other on such Payment
Date, such amounts with respect to each party shall be aggregated, and
the party owing the greater aggregate amount shall pay to the other party
the difference between the amounts owed.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Events of Default</u></b>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">An event of default ("Event of Default") shall mean
with respect to a party (the "Defaulting Party") any of the following:
(a) the failure by the Defaulting Party to make, when due, any payment
required under a Transaction if such failure is not remedied within 2 Business
Days after notice of such failure is given to the Defaulting Party; (b)
any representation or warranty made by the Defaulting Party in a Transaction
which shall prove to have been false or misleading in any material respect;
(c) the breach by the Defaulting Party of any other covenant or agreement
set forth in a Transaction (other than the obligation to make payment)
and such failure is not cured within 10 Business Days after it is given
notice thereof; (d) the institution, with respect to the Defaulting Party,
of a bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium, receivership, liquidation
or similar insolvency proceeding or other relief under any bankruptcy or
insolvency law affecting creditors' rights or a petition is presented or
instituted for its winding-up or liquidation (and, if such a proceeding
is instituted against the party, it remains undismissed for 30 days); (e)
the Defaulting Party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges into or
with, or transfers substantially all of its assets to another entity and
the resulting entity fails to assume all of the obligations of the Defaulting
Party under a Transaction; (f) an event of default occurs (howsoever determined)
under any other Derivative Transaction between the parties; or (g) in respect
of Counterparty, a change of ownership occurs.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Remedies</u></b>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">If an Event of Default shall have occurred and shall
be continuing the non-defaulting party may, in its sole discretion, by
no more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party designate a day no
earlier than the day such notice is effective as an early termination date
("Early Termination Date"). On the Early Termination Date, all obligations
under all Derivative Transactions with respect to all Determination Periods
which would have ended after the Early Termination Date shall be terminated,
except as provided below. If an Early Termination Date has been designated,
the non-defaulting party shall in good faith calculate its Gains or Losses
and Costs resulting from the termination of the parties' obligations under
all Derivative Transactions with respect to all Payment Dates which would
have occurred after the Early Termination Date had the Early Termination
Date not occurred. The non-defaulting party shall aggregate such Gains,
Losses and Costs with respect to all Derivative Transactions into a single
net amount and notify the Defaulting Party of the net amount owed or owing.
If the non-defaulting party's aggregate Losses and Costs exceed its aggregate
Gains, the Defaulting Party shall, within 5 Business Days of receipt of
such notice, pay the net amount to the non-defaulting party, which amount
shall bear interest at the Interest Rate from the Early Termination Date
until paid. If the non-defaulting party's aggregate Gains exceed its Losses
and Costs, if any, resulting from the Event of Default, the non-defaulting
party shall pay the net amount to the Defaulting Party on the Payment Date
for the first next succeeding Determination Period. As used herein with
respect to each party: (a) "Costs" shall mean, with respect to such party,
brokerage fees, commissions and other similar transaction costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by such a party either in terminating any arrangement
pursuant to which it has hedged its obligations or entering into new arrangements
which replace a Transaction; (b) "Gains" shall mean, with respect to a
party, an amount equal to the present value of the economic benefit, if
any, (exclusive of Costs) to it resulting from the termination of its obligations
with respect to a Transaction, determined in a commercially reasonable
manner; and (c) "Losses" shall mean an amount equal to the present value
of the economic loss, if any, (exclusive of Costs) to it resulting from
the termination of its obligations with respect to a Transaction, determined
in a commercially reasonable manner. <b>NO PARTY SHALL BE REQUIRED TO PAY
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES
(WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM A PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE) TO THE OTHER PARTY,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PAYMENTS REQUIRED TO BE MADE PURSUANT TO
A TRANSACTION ARE DEEMED TO BE SUCH DAMAGES. IF AND TO THE EXTENT ANY PAYMENT
MADE PURSUANT TO A TRANSACTION IS DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES,
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE
TO DETERMINE AND THAT SUCH PAYMENT CONSTITUTES A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION
OF THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOT A PENALTY.</b></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">NOTHING IN THIS GTC SHALL HAVE THE EFFECT OF LIMITING
OR RESTRICTING EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY ARISING AS A RESULT OF ITS FRAUD.
ANY LIMITATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY IN THIS
GTC SHALL ONLY APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Setoff</u></b>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Upon the designation of an Early Termination Date,
the Non-Defaulting Party ("X") may, at its option and in its discretion,
setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party ("Y") by X or
any Affiliate of X under a Transaction or under any other agreement(s),
instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of X's
Affiliates under such Transaction or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s)
or undertaking(s). The obligations of Y and X under such Transaction in
respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the
extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates. X will
give Y notice of any setoff effected under this section 6 as soon as practicable
after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of the setoff. For purposes of this section
6, "Owed" shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable
(regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as
of the Early Termination Date.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this section
6 may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed
is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable
manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount
of the currency being converted. If an obligation is unascertained, X may
in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate,
subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation
is ascertained. Nothing in this section 6 shall be effective to create
a charge or other security interest. This setoff provision shall be without
prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, off-set, combination
of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which any party is at
any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).
The parties further acknowledge that each is entering into each Transaction
on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this section 6, as
agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits
of this section 6 and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly
entered into each such Transaction as it relates to section 6.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Miscellaneous</u></b>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Each Transaction and this GTC shall (a) be governed
by, interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of England, and
each party hereby agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
High Court of Justice, England and waives any claim that any proceedings
brought in such courts have been brought in an inconvenient forum; (b)
be binding upon and inure for the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns; however, neither party shall have the
power to assign or otherwise transfer all or any of its rights or obligations
under a Transaction without the prior written consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and any purported
assignment or transfer in violation of this provision shall be void and
of no force and effect; and (c) contain the entire agreement between the
parties and supersede all prior oral or written communications or agreements
relating to the subject matter. All notices in connection with a Transaction
may be given during normal business hours by hand delivery (effective upon
attempted delivery), overnight mail service (effective upon scheduled weekday
delivery day), telex (effective upon receipt of answerback) or telefacsimile
(effective upon receipt of evidence, including telefacsimile evidence,
that telefacsimile was received), as specified or as may be subsequently
designated by effective notice. Any party in default hereunder shall reimburse
the other party, on demand, for actual, reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(and any interest thereon at the Interest Rate), including, without limitation,
reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by the other party during the
occurrence and continuation of such default in connection with the enforcement
of, or the preservation of its rights in respect of a Transaction. The
parties to each Transaction do not intend that any term of such Transaction
should be enforceable, by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties)
Act 1999, by any person who is not a party to such Transaction.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Market Disruption</u></b>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">If a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is
continuing on any Trading Day, the Floating Price for such Trading Day
shall be determined pursuant to the Floating Price Source specified on
this Website for the first Trading Day thereafter on which no Market Disruption
Event exists; provided, however, if the Floating Price is not so determined
within three Business Days after the first Trading Day on which the Market
Disruption Event occurred or existed, then the Floating Price shall be
determined by reference to the Alternative Floating Price Source specified
on this Website, if any, which is not subject to a Market Disruption Event.
If no Alternative Floating Price Source is available or has been specified,
and the Market Disruption Event continues for more than three Business
Days, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree on a Floating
Price (or a method for determining a Floating Price), and if the parties
have not so agreed on or before the twelfth Business Day following the
first Trading Day on which the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed,
then the Floating Price shall be determined in good faith by Enron, in
consultation with Counterparty, taking into account such information (including
one or more dealer quotes) as it deems relevant.</font>

Form</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Upon request, each party shall provide the other
with a properly completed and executed exemption form, certificate or other
document that will allow the other party to make any payment hereunder

<p><font face="Arial">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gross Up</font>
<p><font face="Arial">All payments under a Transaction will be made without
any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax, unless such
deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, modified by
the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority then in effect.
If a party is so required to deduct or withhold then that party ("X") will:</font>
<p><font face="Arial">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promptly notify the other
party ("Y") of such requirement; and=</font>
<p><font face="Arial">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay the relevant authorities
the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including the full
amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid
by X to Y under this subsection (e)) promptly upon the earlier of determining
that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that
such notice that such amount has been assessed against Y; and</font>
<p><font face="Arial">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promptly forward to Y
an official receipt (or certified copy) or other documentation reasonably
acceptable to Y evidencing such payment to such authorities; and</font>

Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment which Y is otherwise entitled
to under this Confirmation, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure
that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable
Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would
have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However,
X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent
that it would not be required to be paid but for: (A) the failure by Y
to comply with or perform any agreement contained in subsection (c) or
(d); or (B) the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to subsection
(b) to be accurate and true, unless such failure would not have occurred
but for a Change of Tax Law.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liability</font>
<p><font face="Arial">If:</font>
<p><font face="Arial">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X is required by any
applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental
revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which
X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under subsection

<p><font face="Arial">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X does not so deduct
or withhold; and</font>
<p><font face="Arial">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A liability resulting
from such Tax is assessed directly against X then, except to the extent
that Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such
Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such liability (including any
related liability for interest, but including any related liability for
penalties only if Y failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained
in subsection (c) or (d)).</font>

or Enron will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the
next succeeding payment date:</font>

the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax
(except in respect of any interest payable under the Confirmation); or</font>
<p><font face="Arial">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receive a payment from
which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld on account of a
Tax (except in respect of any interest payable under the Confirmation)
and no additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax
under subsection (e)(4) (other than by reason of subsection (e)(4)(A) or
(B)) then such party may, in its sole discretion, upon two (2) Business
Days notice to the other party, designate an Early Termination Date under
Section 5 of this GTC. For purposes of calculating Gains, Losses and Costs
under Section 5 of this GTC, the party designating the Early Termination
Date as a result of a Change in Tax Law shall be treated as the Defaulting
Party, and the other party shall be treated as the non-defaulting party.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miscellaneous</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It shall not be an Event of Default under this GTC
if any of the representations or warranties contained in this Section prove
to have been false or misleading in any material respect or if a party
breaches any agreement or covenant in this Section.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Currency Provisions</u></b>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Each payment under each Transaction will be made
in the Contractual Currency. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
if any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual
Currency is rendered for the payment of any amount owing under a Transaction,
the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount
to which such party is entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will
be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any
shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence
of sums paid in such other currency and will promptly refund to the other
party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such party as
a result of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or excess
arises or results from any variation between the exchange rate (including
any premiums and exchange costs) at which the Contractual Currency is converted
into the currency of the judgment or order for purposes of the judgment
or order and the exchange rate (including any premiums and exchange costs)
at which such party is able, acting in a reasonable and good faith manner
in converting the currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase
the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment
or order actually received by such party.</font>

Enron Corp. would like to reexecute the guaranty (everything the same but with proper date) so we will deliver a new guaranty and certificate.  We ask that upon receipt, you return the guaranty that you are now holding.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

We are in the midst of obtaining the certificate.<br>
<br>
Also, I just noticed that the effective date is missing the year &quot;2001&quot;.<br>
Would you like to insert it and we will initial?<br>
<br>
Thanks.  Sara<br>

   indicating<br>
   that the signatory<br>
    on the guaranty has full authorirization? Thanks in advance for your<br>
   help<br>

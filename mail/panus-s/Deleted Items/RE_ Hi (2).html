That sounds like fun.  We might be out of town for the weekend.  Raymond's friend has some land about halfway between Dallas and Houston.  We were thinking of going up Thurs night or Fri morning.  If we do go out of town, we need to get together next week(end). Give me a call.  We'll be around tonight.<br>

Hey Steph!<br>
<br>
I just got back from Italy!  Got a last minute assignment on the 7th to<br>
travel on the 10th and just returned on the 16th.  It was cool b/c it was<br>
Italy but a longer and less busy trip would have been better!<br>
<br>
How long are Nancy &amp; Michael in town?  I'd love to meet up with yall.<br>
<br>
I've got to tell you that I've got this person who is visiting me this<br>
weekend (actually Thurs-sun).  He's been a good friend for a long time and I<br>
like him a lot. If I meet up with you guys, I may bring him along if that's<br>
alright.<br>
<br>
I'm going to my grandparents house for Thanksgiving.  Going to be strange<br>
b/c Todd's not there and it's going to be the thing that everyone's thinking<br>
but now saying - you know what I mean?<br>
<br>
My phone #s are 281-483-2241 work and 713-533-9785 home and I can't recall<br>
my cell right now.<br>
<br>
We need to do dinner or pre-dinner drinks (or just skip dinner) and bitch<br>
about the idiots we both work with!!!<br>
<br>
Let me know what's up!<br>
<br>
Jenn<br>

Hey, Jen,<br>
What's been going on?  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  I seem to<br>
have missplaced your phone numbers (I'm sure if I dug through my pile of<br>
junk at home I would find them!).  Give me a call.  Nancey &amp; Michael are<br>
going to be in town for Turkey Day.  Lots of fun going on at my office<br>
these days.<br>

Unfortunately the appointment schedule for flu shots this week is completely full.  You may ask why.....well, the amount of vaccine we received for this first round was very small.  Don't despair, our supplier has notified us that we may be receiving another shipment of vaccine by the end of next week.  We cannot start to schedule yet since we do not know how much vaccine we're getting, nor when we will be getting it. Please check back with us or keep an eye on your Enron email as we will be sending out an announcement regarding the second round of flu shots.  <br>
<br>
We appreciate your patience regarding this matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Regarding the waiting list that was announced through Enron in Action - we have not been instructed to keep a waiting list.  That seems to be an error.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Please check back with us or look for an email message regarding the next round of flu shots.<br>

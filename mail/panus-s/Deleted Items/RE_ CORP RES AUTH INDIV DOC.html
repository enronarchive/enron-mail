We have our own form of corporate resolutions.  It was being circulated for signature by the directors and I just received it back today.  I told Kelly Keneally when I sent the documentation to her that we were in the process of routing this for signature and that I would send her a certificate certifying these resolutions when completed.<br>

Apparently CSFB neglected to ask us to complete the attached corporate resolution when we executed the broker agreement.  If we could fill out and forward on that would be great.<br>

If we are seeking to put in place a multi commodity guaranty, what has become of natural gas and emissions? I thought we were going to include these as well, any reason why these are not included in the guaranty? Are there any other commodities we would want covered under this guaranty?<br>
	<br>
I have made the change to reflect that I would hope that Exelon would in fact execute an EEI Master Agreement, the same change will need to be made to both documents	<br>
I would prefer it if New York law governed these guarantees.<br>
<br>
Please see attached mark-up.<br>

You wanted to look at the guarantees being prepared for Exelon Generation and ENA/EPMI.<br>

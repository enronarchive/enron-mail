Mr. Ross,<br>
The alternate Letter of Credit format is acceptable and we will make this change.  I have asked Nidia Mendoza in our Credit dept. to respond to you regarding the collateral rounding amount you mentioned below.<br>

Subject:	RE: ISDA Master Agreement<br>
<br>
Ms. Panus,<br>
<br>
A number of months ago you had sent me a draft Master Agreement and Credit<br>
Support Annex.  I had then spoke with Nidia Mendoza, in the Enron Credit<br>
department, regarding the changes we would like to see in the agreement.<br>
However, I am having problems getting her to respond to my phone messages or<br>
e-mails.<br>
<br>
I am hoping I could detail the changes we have and  you could then let me<br>
know if they are acceptable.<br>
<br>
They are as follows:<br>
<br>
Ms. Mendoza faxed me an alternate Letter of Credit format, which our Bank<br>
finds more acceptable than SCHEDULE 1 to EXHIBIT A to paragraph 13 of Annex<br>
A.<br>
<br>
We would like to have this format replace the current SCHEDULE 1 or have it<br>
added as SCHEDULE 2. This will guard against the format being disallowed at<br>
a latter date.<br>
<br>
Also, we would like to have the dollar amounts in point (b) (iv) (D) of<br>
PARAGRAPH 13 to the ISDA CREDIT SUPPORT ANNEX reduced from $250,000 to<br>
$10,000.  A $250,000 threshold is a very large number especially when you<br>
consider that we would not be paid any interest, while Enron held any excess<br>
funds. Also, the $10,000 amount is typical of the amount we use with other<br>
trading houses of Enron's size.<br>
<br>
Please let me know your thoughts on the above items. If you have any<br>
questions please contact me, at (403) 215-7451.<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>
<br>
Gary Ross<br>
<br>

Mr. Ross,<br>
<br>
Attached for your review is a draft of the ISDA Master Agreement between<br>
Enron North America Corp. and Quadra Energy Trading Ltd.  Please note<br>
that the actual Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex are preprinted<br>
forms from ISDA and cannot be sent electronically.  Therefore, I am also<br>
sending you the entire package via overnight delivery.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, please call me at the below number or Brent<br>
Hendry, Senior Counsel, at 713-853-7124.  We look forward to hearing<br>
your comments.<br>

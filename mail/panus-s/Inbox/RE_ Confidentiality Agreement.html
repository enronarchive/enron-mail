I spoke to Stephanie yesterday and she updated the Confidentiality Agreement following our discussion.  The following references status of the points discussed:<br>
 <br>
1.    The updated agreement includes a definition of &quot;affiliate&quot;.  This is acceptable to me.  <br>
 <br>
2.    Two year term.  This is okay.<br>
 <br>
3.    Request for Californiajurisdiction.  Stephanie said they could not agree to a Californiajurisdiction.  Her argument calling for a New Yorkjurisdiction is that the purpose of the Confidentiality Agreement is to facilitate a credit review, and Enron is familiar with dealing with credit matters under New Yorklaw.  <br>
 <br>
4.    Arbitration.  I told her we would agree to no changes on Arbitration wording from Enron format.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
I told Stephanie that I would discuss with you before I get back to her.  <br>
 <br>
Thanks.<br>

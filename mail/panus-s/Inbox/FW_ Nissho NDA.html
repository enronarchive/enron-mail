I wanted to let you know this was coming in as soon as Mark approves the changes.  Dealing with Japan is somewhat time challenging.<br>

Please approve or make changes to their new NDA.  They need to change the counterparty name due to a joint venture.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Diamond-san,<br>
<br>
As I wrote in the past, Nissho Iwai's LNG related department<br>
has been transferred into a new joint venture company between<br>
Nissho and Sumitomo Corp. as of October 1, 2001, namely,<br>
 &quot;LNG Japan Corp.&quot;.<br>
<br>
In this connection, we would like to conclude another NDA with<br>
LNG Japan Corp, as per attached.<br>
<br>
Please review it and it would be great if you could make original again<br>
and send us for Mr.Miyazawa's signature.<br>
<br>
Also, please advise us how we should treat Nissho's NDA in these<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
BTW, I talked with Mr.Matsubara, Manager of Enron Global Finance in Tokyo.<br>
We are internally discussing when we start our official meeting.<br>
Please let us know when you are ready.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
<br>
LNG Japan Corporation<br>
D.Kobayashi<br>

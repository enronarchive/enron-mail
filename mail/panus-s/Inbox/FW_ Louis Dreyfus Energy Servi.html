Stephanie,  <br>
<br>
Prior to the execution of the ISDA Master, LD had crossed out some stuff on their confirms (ex. governing law) and stuff on the Annex - and we have been unable to fully execute these outstanding deals.  So... since any outstanding deals are now covered by the Master, what do we do about the ones that weren't fully executed and had markups?  <br>
<br>

Can you remind me what the problems were?  If they were related to confirming trades, all trades should now be confirmed under the Master Agreement and all trades that were confirmed prior to the execution of the Master will also now be governed by the Master.<br>

Hey Stephanie.  Now that they have signed this ISDA for Louis Drefus Energy Services, LP, how does that effect the confirmations that have been sent out in the past?  We are assuming this ISDA addressed the problems that were sent up to legal a few months ago (Frank Sayre) and we now need to know how to move forward and get our existing confirmations executed.  Can you confirm if it did address the issues we sent to legal and how we need to proceed to get these outstanding confirmations executed?  <br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
FYI, we have confirmations in 'Sent to Counterparty' status since December 13, 2000.<br>

Hi Stephanie,<br>
<br>
The counterparty is Harrah's Operating Company, Inc. (Rated BBB-) and they <br>
are domesticly based.  They would be buying a 2 year plain-vanilla fixed <br>
price swap (the volume is small; 10,000 MMBtu/month).  I understand ENA would <br>
prepare &amp; send-out the confirm.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
Ken<br>

Ken,<br>
<br>
Are they looking for  a &quot;sample&quot; confirmation to see what it will look like?  <br>
In speaking with Brent Hendry, an attorney in our group, we need to know more <br>
information about this counterparty and the type of trades they will be doing <br>
before sending out anything.  Our forms vary depending on the type of <br>
counterparty and trade being done, and may look different depending on credit <br>
terms.  Also, if the trade is going to be done in the name of ENA, then ENA <br>
needs to prepare and send out the confirmation.<br>
<br>
Can you send us what information you have on the counterparty/trade?  If you <br>
have any questions, please contact myself or Brent Hendry.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>

As discussed, please send a copy of ENA's standard long-form swap <br>
confirmation.  We have a customer who is potentially going to trade with ENA <br>
and they'd like to review the confirm as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help.<br>

Dear Amazon.com Customer,<br>

<br>

<br>
If you haven't yet explored Amazon.com this holiday season, come and<br>
discover all the ways you can save on great gifts for everyone on<br>
your list:<br>
<br>
- Lower Prices: Save 30% or more on books over $20.<br>

So make the holidays extra special for your loved ones this year<br>
with those perfect, personal gifts. But be sure to shop soon to<br>

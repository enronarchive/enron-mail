Dynegy Issues Statement On Enron Merger Status<br>
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 21, 2001--Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN - news) Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson today said he is encouraged by <br>
Enron Corp.'s report this morning that it has closed the remaining $450 million credit facility secured by the assets of Northern Natural Gas Pipeline and <br>
has received a commitment from its lead bank to extend the $690 million note payable obligation described in Enron's recent 10-Q filing. <br>
<br>
``We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance<br>
 with the previously announced agreement,'' he said. <br>
<br>
Watson also noted that ChevronTexaco recently reiterated that it has ``full confidence in Dynegy's disciplined management approach to complete the <br>
merger and to build a new company into an industry leader.'' ChevronTexaco owns 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. <br>

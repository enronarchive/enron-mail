1. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Broadband providers hit the canvas<br>
DSL has fumbled the ball and cable has hit the deck, but the ref <br>
hasn't counted them out...yet<br>
<br>
By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer<br>
<br>
It has been a tough year for broadband access providers in the US.  <br>
On the digital subscriber line (DSL) front, wholesalers Rhythms <br>
Net Connections (RTHMQ), North Point and Covad <br>
(COVD.OB) hit the canvas.  Covad is in the process of getting <br>
back on its feet, but its future remains uncertain.  On the cable side, <br>
Excite@Home recently filed for bankruptcy, and numerous <br>
broadband wireless providers including Winstar and Metricom <br>
have also dissolved.  But what lies ahead for those that survive?<br>
<br>
While DSL technology has fumbled the ball early in the game and <br>
is now unlikely to ever live up to its promise, cable and satellite <br>
providers still have a chance to run for daylight. But for the time <br>
being, dial-up remains the clear market leader.<br>
<br>
Indeed, eMarketer predicts continuing growth in the dial-up sector, <br>
at least for 2002, even though broadband services will become <br>
more widespread. Dial-up will taper off in the following years, but <br>
it will still be the most common means of Internet access in the <br>
home even as late as 2004.  AOL, with its 26 million subscribers <br>
(not counting Road Runner) as of September 2001, will continue to <br>
dominate the scene. Its nearest competitors, MSN (7 million <br>
subscribers), United Online (6.1 million subscribers) and <br>
Earthlink (ELNK) (4.9 million subscribers) will battle it out for <br>
second place.  Even if the largest five ISPs after AOL merged, they <br>
would still fail to rival AOL Time Warner (AOL).<br>

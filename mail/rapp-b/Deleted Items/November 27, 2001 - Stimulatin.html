1. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES<br>
Stimulus is the key going forward<br>
Investors themselves, and not any single outside force, may <br>
generate a further market rally.<br>
<br>
By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies<br>
<br>
With Thanksgiving smack dab in the middle of the week, it was hard determining <br>
what the market wanted to do or where investors' heads were at. After all, the <br>
market seemed to be running on empty until the holiday-shortened Friday <br>
session, when the market zoomed. Of course, sticking with the engine analogy, <br>
nay-sayers will say that the market was just rolling downhill, benefiting from an <br>
abbreviated session that saw lighter-than-normal volume. I would agree that <br>
Fridays session wasnt an apples-to-apples comparison with regular sessions--it <br>
was more like running a soapbox derby racer versus an open-wheel Indy-type <br>
car that the market typically runs during a full session. According to those folks <br>
that dont believe in the current market rally, Fridays results were amusing and <br>
even entertaining, but of no enduring value.<br>
<br>
It would be easy to write the session off as a day-race that held little value in the <br>
grand scheme of things, but that would be a big mistake. In the soapbox derby, <br>
gravity draws the homemade racers down a modest hill. The same could have <br>
happened to stocks on Friday. Instead stocks climbed up that same modest hill. <br>
Stocks defied both gravity and the naysayers by trading higher and higher as the <br>
day went on. There is a message in that achievement: I think it tells us that when <br>
left to its own devices, the market wants to rally higher. Sure, when there are <br>
earnings reports, economic data, brokerage downgrades, wars, unemployment, <br>
fear, and warnings from corporate America, the race becomes akin to handling a <br>
high-performance race car and turning corners at 180 miles an hour. It isnt as <br>
easy as it looks.<br>

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Models of success?<br>
Surviving Internet players have better business models, but share <br>
prices may still be too high for some.<br>
<br>
By Dave Sterman<br>
<br>
In a few weeks, 2001 will come to a close, putting the wraps on a forgettable year <br>
for the Internet sector. Many firms have already headed for bankruptcy, and other <br>
weaker players are also expected to shutter operations later in the winter. <br>
<br>
But investors are clearly focusing on the eventual winners in the Internet space, <br>
as share prices for healthier companies have been soaring in recent weeks. This <br>
week, we went looking for net stocks that are still growing and appear firmly in <br>
the &quot;survivor&quot; category.  <br>
<br>
We specifically looked for Web-oriented companies that are boosting sales at a <br>
heady clip. As the accompanying table shows, these stocks have also seen their <br>
shares rise sharply, leading to the question: are they still a bargain? <br>

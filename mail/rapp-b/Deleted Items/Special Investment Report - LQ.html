From NYTimes.com -- A Special Investment <br>
Report From StockTopics.com*<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Wall Street Alert - Special Investment Report - LQDX<br>
   Smart investors understand that companies with <br>
government and military applications are especially <br>
attractive in times of global instability.<br>
   Our current recommendation, LIQUIDIX, INC. of Arizona <br>
(OTC BB: LQDX), has positioned itself as the leading <br>
competitor in the high-tech industrial manufacturing <br>
industry with its customizable array of magnetic fluid <br>
vacuum seals.<br>
   NASA, Honeywell, ADM, Intel, have already used the <br>
vacuum seals created by Liquidix. These products benefit <br>
such important technologies as navigational gyros, <br>
infrared detectors, heat-seeking missiles, laser sighting <br>
and night-vision equipment.<br>
   Liquidix has signed contracts with several <br>
Military/Government Agencies and U.S. National <br>
Laboratories, including NASA, which have produced <br>
significant growth in the company.<br>
   Liquidix is one of only three companies in the world to <br>
produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it's the only one <br>
that is traded publicly in the United States. Because <br>
costs in this industry are very similar between companies, <br>
Liquidix has studied and surpassed its competition in <br>
delivery time. Liquidix can deliver the same product to <br>
its destination in 1/4 the time of its nearest competitor, <br>
making them especially desirable for companies who must <br>
meet an increasing demand for magnetic fluid vacuum seals.   <br>
Liquidix has conservatively estimated that their gross <br>
revenues for 2002 will increase more than 40% over 2001, <br>
and by 2003 will increase another 110%. Through strategic <br>
mergers and acquisitions Liquidix also estimates that <br>
their profit margins for 2002 will increase by 60% over <br>
2001, and by 2003 will increase another 200%.<br>
<br>
REASONS TO OWN THE STOCK<br>
  1. Liquidix provides magnetic fluid vacuum seals for <br>
government and military applications that are in higher <br>
demand due to increasing military activity in the U.S.<br>
  2. Liquidix, through strategic alliances and <br>
acquisitions, has established itself as the leader of an <br>
industry that is projected to earn more than $4.5 billion <br>
dollars by 2002.<br>
  3. Liquidix provides products to industry giants such as <br>
NASA, HONEYWELL, INTEL, and ADM, virtually guaranteeing <br>
the growth of this strong company.<br>
  4. Liquidix aggressive and strategic acquisition of <br>
companies like Advanced Fluid Systems demonstrates a <br>
strong vision for the future and positions them as a world <br>
leader in magnetic fluid technology.<br>
  5. Liquidix is one of only three companies in the world <br>
to produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it is the only <br>
one that is traded publicly in the U.S.<br>
  6. Facilities owned and operated by Liquidix in the <br>
United States and Europe have given the company a foothold <br>
on both sides of the Atlantic, with opportunities to break <br>
into additional international markets.<br>

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Mobile phone makers eye wireless Internet opportunity<br>
Companies look past current troubles toward growing the mobile data market<br>
<br>
by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist<br>
<br>
Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile <br>
handset industry. The segments top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone <br>
sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues.<br>
<br>
Its no surprise given recent industry performance. Third quarter handset shipments <br>
were down by 10% over last year. Motorolas (MOT) sales fell by 22% in the quarter, <br>
and Ericssons (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging to its bottom line <br>
that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with Sony (SNE).<br>

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Angelic missions rising<br>
As VC funding slows, angel investors find new wings.<br>
<br>
By Carla Drysdale<br>
<br>
As the country struggles to its feet after the crash of the new economy, <br>
exacerbated by the Sept. 11th attacks on the WTC, angel investors have <br>
been doing their part to help by continuing to provide seed money to startups. <br>
<br>
Angels, entrepreneurs-turned-investors, first earned this moniker during <br>
depression-era New York by bailing out ailing Broadway theatre companies. <br>
Since then, angel investments, along with those of venture capitalists, have <br>
expanded from Broadway to the Internet and beyond. Now, because traditional <br>
VCs are slowing the pace of investments, angels have new opportunities to <br>
swoop down to fill in the seed-stage gap. <br>

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Beware the ghosts of Christmas 2001<br>
Spirits are hanging over the markets, not all of <br>
which promise happy returns.<br>
<br>
By Rick Wayman, CFA<br>
<br>
The market will face some difficult challenges during the next two <br>
quarters, and investors need to be aware of these issues in order to <br>
invest wisely. So, in the spirit of the coming season, and with <br>
apologies to Charles Dickens, I would like to introduce you to <br>
these challenges as the ghosts of Christmas--Version 2001. <br>
<br>
Our main theme is that the economy is not as good as the market <br>
currently thinks it is, and that earnings will come under increased <br>
pressure by issues that have not yet appeared on the Streets radar. <br>
The combination of these forces could depress stocks near-term, <br>
but could also result in a classic January rally.<br>

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Value without tears<br>
Those who follow our value-oriented screens know that <br>
value investors don't just wind up buying dogs. <br>
<br>
By Marc Gerstein<br>
<br>
All investors risk getting involved with dogs every day. But value <br>
investors need to be especially sensitive to the matter, since they <br>
make a regular practice of searching for stocks that look attractive <br>
based on some simple arithmetic that any investor can do, and on <br>
answers that anyone can see. If you're searching for value, you <br>
almost have to presume that anything you uncover is a dog until <br>
you receive specific evidence showing otherwise.<br>

1. Mortgage on MultexPF <br>
Protecting your right to ownership<br>
<br>
Most insurance looks to the future, but title <br>
insurance looks to the past. A title insurance policy protects <br>
you against problems that occurred long before you bought <br>
a home  problems resulting from defects in the title.<br>

2. Retirement on MultexPF <br>
Using an annuity to save for retirement<br>
<br>
An annuity is something of a cross between a life <br>
insurance policy and a mutual fund. Some experts hate annuities; <br>

Flood insurance <br>
<br>

Dear Cartoon Bank Member,<br>
<br>
I'm going to take 20% off the price of our New Yorker Vintage Cover prints, <br>
and here's why:<br>
<br>
When I woke up this morning, the sun was shining and there was no <br>
suspicious-looking powder in my mail.<br>
<br>
So I threw away my hazmat suit (which had just come back from the cleaners) <br>
and started to think that things were getting back to normal even if it was <br>
a &quot;new normal&quot; on its way to becoming an old normal once an even newer <br>
normal came along.<br>
<br>
All this put me in a good mood and now I want to put you in a good mood too.<br>
<br>
So throw away your hazmat suit and check out our new Vintage Cover <br>
Collection online at http://www.cartoonbank.com/covers_1.asp.<br>
<br>
You can buy our cover prints framed and matted or just matted (but the <br>
framed versions are really spectacular and with 20% off, a super great deal.)<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the Pilgrims couldn't buy these unique artistic <br>
reproductions.  They had to hang colored corn on their walls.<br>
<br>
But with our new Vintage Cover collection, you can save the corn for the <br>
table.<br>
<br>
Decorate with cover prints instead.<br>
<br>
Visit our site at www.cartoonbank.com.  Our on-line display features a <br>
popular selection of New Yorker covers from 1925 to 1992.  Some are moody <br>
and artistic, others are whimsical, even hilarious.  All are perfect moments <br>
in time.<br>
<br>
If you don't see the cover or artist you want, give us a call at <br>
1-800-897-8666 and we'll search our office database.  While not all covers <br>
are available, most are.    And with hundreds to choose from, I'm confident <br>
we can find one that will make you feel as good as I'm feeling right now!<br>
<br>
Happy Thanksgiving to you and the family.<br>
<br>
Normally yours,<br>
<br>
Bob<br>
<br>
P.S.  I went to visit my 94-year-old mother the other day.  I told her that <br>
her beloved granddaughter has a new pony.  &quot;Pony!  What does she need that <br>
for!&quot; she snorted. &quot;I prefer live humans.&quot;  And that's the beauty of The <br>
Cartoon Bank's Vintage Cover Collection! You can get a beautiful artistic <br>
print of a pony or of humans! So what could be bad?<br>

QUOTE OF THE DAY<br>
=========================<br>
&quot;I'm thankful I'm alive, but I feel guilty I'm alive. I'm<br>
trying to remember the guys who aren't here. Their wives<br>
and children. It's a   hollow feeling. You try to laugh<br>
sometimes to keep   your sanity, but you feel bad   about<br>
laughing.&quot;<br>
-ROBERT MADDALONE, Firefighter, Squad 1 <br>

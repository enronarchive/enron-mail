Over the past few days, we have tried to address many of your questions and concerns regarding the current issues at Enron. However, we realize that many of you may still have and may also be receiving questions from our customers. To that end, Enron has compiled a list of FAQs and answers regarding both the third party transaction issue and the SEC inquiry.  You can find this information on our internet site at http://www.enron.com/corp/investors/. Please utilize this resource for both your questions and those of our customers.  We will update this as necessary.<br>
<br>
If you have questions that are still unanswered, please forward them to our office and we will do our best to provide a response to your inquiry through this venue. <br>
<br>
We appreciate your continued hard work and day-to-day commitment. <br>

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Can equipment makers overcome a capex slowdown in 2002?<br>
Analysts believe that a few stocks are worth buying despite continued belt <br>
tightening.<br>
<br>
by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist<br>
<br>
The 2002 capex picture for large carriers is coming into focus, and it isn't <br>
pretty. The push to control spending will continue, and capex budgets look <br>
to be slashed by an average of 25 percent next year.<br>

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Better safe than sorry<br>
In an insecure world, Corporate America is investing in security software<br>
<br>
By Carla Drysdale<br>
<br>
If you're like me, a &quot;virus warning&quot; in your email inbox isn't likely to faze you. <br>
You click on it and glance through it, with a vague sense of gratitude that <br>
the warning will hopefully prevent your computer from imploding. <br>
<br>
So at first I took it in stride when I received a message saying: &quot;If you receive <br>
an email entitled 'Bad Times,' delete it IMMEDIATELY. Apparently this one is <br>
pretty nasty.&quot; <br>
<br>
I thought, okay, and I kept reading. &quot;It will not only erase everything on your <br>
hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks within 20 feet of your <br>
computer...It will do all your drugs and drink all your liquor.&quot; Now that's a nasty <br>
virus! While this science fiction scenario might have been written by someone <br>
who's seen The Matrix once too often, it is a tongue-in-cheek reminder that smart <br>
hackers can wreak all kinds of havoc. <br>
<br>
Fortunately for the makers of anti-virus software, Fortune 100 companies are <br>
acutely aware of the problem, and they are keeping security software firms busier <br>
than ever--and that makes them an attractive target for private equity as well. <br>

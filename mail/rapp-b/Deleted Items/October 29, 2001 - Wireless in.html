10. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
As computers become communications devices, innovative chip<br>
architecture is a smart investment.<br>
<br>
Post dot-com distraction, venture capitalists are cautious about &quot;the next<br>
big thing.&quot; VC columnist Carla Drysdale writes that an area they are<br>
returning to, despite current market softness, is semiconductors. Since<br>
communications and Internet technologies depend on advances in<br>
semiconductor electronics and software, chip startups are getting noticed.<br>

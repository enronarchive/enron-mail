1. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES<br>
Advent Software (ADVS)<br>
What can you say about a tech stock that analysts tout even while estimates <br>
drop? How about: Nice!<br>
<br>
By Marc Gerstein<br>
   <br>
Usually analysts like stocks when earnings are growing, and they are most <br>
bullish on shares of companies whose earnings growth is especially strong. <br>
That's a major reason why tech stocks have been in the doghouse lately. <br>
Earnings have been heading south. Whether or not you want to invest in tech <br>
now generally depends on how patient you are. If you're willing to get in early and <br>
wait until earnings recover and estimates get revised upward (something that will <br>
probably be occurring around mid-2002), this is a great time to jump in. If you're <br>
not so patient, you have to agonize trying to guess the timing of recovery.<br>

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
From Russia with love<br>
A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining <br>
analyst esteem.<br>
<br>
by Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist<br>
<br>
When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of <br>
analyst esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look.<br>
<br>
To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest <br>
rating, but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an <br>
average rating better than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an <br>
average rating of 2 (&quot;buy&quot;). What gives? <br>

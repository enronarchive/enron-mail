1. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Gone digital<br>
Companies with digital in their names seem to be on a roll.<br>
<br>
By Dave Sterman<br>
<br>
Whats in a name? Plenty, if youre talking about the word &quot;digital.&quot; <br>
Screening for fast-growing Net stocks, we found that three of them use <br>
that ubiquitous moniker in their title. Recently, we chronicled the bright <br>
prospects for Digital Insight (DGIN).<br>
<br>
This week, were looking at the other digitals, and found a pretty <br>
ompelling investment case for each of those as well. Both DigitalThink <br>
(DTHK) and Digital River (DRIV) are taking advantage of the unique selling <br>
properties associated with the Web.<br>

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Charge!!!<br>
Consumers came to the rescue of retailers, and individual investors <br>
will come to the rescue of the street.<br>
<br>
by Charles Payne, founder, chief executive officer and principal analyst, Wall <br>
Street Strategies<br>
<br>
Last week saw a marked contrast to the previous week as the Northern Alliance <br>
went from the Keystone Cops to a liberating rebel force, pushing the Taliban <br>
back on their heels (or on their toes, as they scatter to caves and tunnels in <br>
the southern part of Afghanistan). Wall Street mavens and the media suggested <br>
that stocks were pushed higher by the war victories, and while I agree that <br>
the prospect of a short war is a positive element for the market, I believe <br>
that the week's success had some domestic ingredients as well. In fact, I think <br>
the most telling moment of the week came when retail sales figures were released <br>
last Wednesday, once again beating expectations. <br>
<br>
In the previous week, many observers were surprised to see that consumer <br>
sentiment (as monitored by the Michigan survey) came in well above estimates, <br>
and was quickly dismissed as some type of fluke. After last week, though, I <br>
dont think anyone can question the resolve of the American consumer.<br>

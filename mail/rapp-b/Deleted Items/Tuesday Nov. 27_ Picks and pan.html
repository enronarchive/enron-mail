1. Picks and pans: Telecom favorites and has-beens<br>
Charles Payne rates 17 telecom stocks that sank like hot air balloons for their <br>
ability to regain altitude or not.<br>
<br>
By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies <br>
<br>
The telecommunications sector's equipment makers has been at the root of all <br>
the heartache felt by investors over the last two-years; it represents the <br>
bloated inventories and even more bloated valuations; investors thought they <br>
were gliding to a land of early retirements, vacation homes and endless toys when <br>
the balloon began to lose air (it didn't pop, but behaved more like a hot air <br>
balloon that descended faster and faster as it approached a hard landing). <br>
Like visionaries in love with a concept, investors are still in love with <br>
the telecommunications space and will continue to bet on the balloon recovering <br>
altitude and taking flight once more. I agree that some of these balloons will <br>
indeed become airborne, but getting them off the ground will be trickier than <br>
advertised.<br>

2. Upwards revisions: Better and better<br>
Rather than taking the sector as a whole, investors should consider individual <br>
opportunities.<br>
<br>
By Dave Sterman<br>
<br>
Recessions are something of a double-edged sword for investors. On the one hand, <br>
sales growth slows for many of their portfolio companies, taking share prices <br>
on a southbound trajectory. But for those with cash to spare, they have a rare <br>
chance to buy quality companies at fire sale prices.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, we went screening for long-term winners in the telecom sector <br>
that are now quite cheap. We specifically sought out stocks that are now fairly <br>
inexpensive when compared to their historical earnings growth rate. As the  <br>
accompanying table shows, these stocks have a PEG (price/earnings ratio in <br>
relation to earnings growth) of below 0.7. <br>
<br>
And to make sure that analyst sentiment corroborates the attractive valuation, <br>
we insisted these stocks be supported by at least three &quot;strong buy&quot; ratings, <br>
and that analysts have raised their ratings over the last three months.<br>

3. Upside potential: Unusual support looms for tower stocks<br>
Debt burdens and zoning laws may seem like unlikely benefits, but there you <br>
have it.<br>
<br>
By Dave Sterman<br>
<br>
Toss another sector into the telecom rubble. Shares of cell tower operators <br>
are hitting new lows and now sell for just a small fraction of their peaks. <br>
Curiously, on many levels, the sector is fairly healthy; revenues are strong, <br>
and major players have been able to avoid the cutthroat price wars that have <br>
characterized the rest of the telecom industry.<br>
<br>
That apparent disconnect could spell an opportunity for investors with a strong <br>
stomach for a long and bumpy ride. These firms are saddled with eye-popping <br>
levels of debt, but should soon benefit from a much more rational operating <br>
landscape. Weaker players are on the ropes, and their eventual demise will enable <br>
the stronger players to get back on their feet as they garner a bigger slice of <br>
the pie.<br>

4. International wires: From Russia with love<br>
A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining <br>
analyst esteem.<br>
<br>
BYLINE: Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist<br>
<br>
When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of analyst <br>
esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look.<br>
<br>
To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest rating, <br>
but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an average rating better <br>
than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an average rating of 2 (&quot;buy&quot;). <br>
What gives?<br>

5. Changing directions: Mobile phone makers eye wireless Internet opportunity<br>
Companies look past current troubles toward growing the mobile data market<br>
<br>
by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist<br>
<br>
Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile <br>
handset industry. The segment's top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone <br>
sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues.<br>
<br>
It's no surprise given recent industry performance. Third quarter handset <br>
shipments were down by 10% over last year. Motorola's (MOT) sales fell by 22% <br>
in the quarter, and Ericsson's (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging <br>
to its bottom line that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with <br>
Sony (SNE).<br>

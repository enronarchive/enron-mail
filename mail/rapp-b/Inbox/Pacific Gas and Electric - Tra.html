 I received a call from Jack Foley from the PG&amp;E Credit Risk area regarding concerns to their exposure from TW. He cited that due to the' CC' S &amp; P rating they had concerns regarding their monthly prepayment to TW of approximately $ 1.8 M, our marketing of their excess capacity, and the Operating Agreement at the interconnect regarding indemnification of the PCB cleanup.<br>
He stated that PG&amp;E has exposure as a result of TW marketing their excess capacity which at present TW has paid PG &amp; E it's portion. However, we are due to remarket in January for their Spring/Summer capacity where we bill, collect and remit to PG &amp;E. Also, he advised that per the Operating Agreement at the interconnect, dated June 27, 1995, there is an indemnification for PCB cleanup and that we pay PG &amp; E $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 per year and the agreement runs to 2007. He added that there is a reaffirmation of the 1995 agreement dated May 28,1999, with Steve and Lou as the signers. <br>
<br>
In order to alleviate their concerns, Foley proposed, 1) TW drop the prepayment requirement and 2) provide security/collateral to secure the remarketing and PCB cleanup.<br>
<br>
Please review and advise your comments.<br>

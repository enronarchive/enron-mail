Good morning Bill -<br>
<br>
Please know that I have not forgotten, and in fact looked forward to, our <br>
meeting this afternoon.  I had hesitated in sending a reply only because the <br>
youngest developed a pretty nasty cough on Saturday.  He is prone to <br>
pneumonia so I have placed a call to his Dr. to see how this can be avoided.<br>
<br>
I will have to read the other e-mail but I am thinking that you mentioned <br>
that lunch Wednesday might work for you also?  I do not expect to have to <br>
stay home with Tad 2 for more than today and my lunch schedule is pretty <br>
open.  Perhaps you could look at your calendar and see if there is another <br>
day that would work for you?<br>
<br>
Many thanks for understanding - much appreciated on my end - Lili<br>
<br>

&gt;Lili,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;     I haven't heard back from you re lunch tomorrow, so I'll assume we're <br>
&gt;not going to meet since I can't check my personal e-mails at the office. If <br>
&gt;you get this message and do want to meet, you can call me at the office <br>
&gt;tomorrow (Monday) morning. My office number is (713)853-5269. Or you can <br>
&gt;e-mail me at the office at: brapp@enron.com. If you'd like to meet later in <br>
&gt;the week, that's fine too. Take care.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;                                 Bill<br>

What's in store<br>
Investors get ready to ride into smoother waters  <br>
 <br>
By Carla Drysdale, columnist <br>
 <br>
As we bid farewell to a year in which many of us dealt <br>
directly with loss of lives, jobs, and investments, the <br>
Big Ball of 2002 is poised to bring in what we hope will <br>
be a brighter new year. Now, more than halfway <br>
through the fourth quarter, the venture capital market <br>
is still far from robust. Where will it go from here and <br>
which will be the startups that drive VC investments in <br>
2002? <br>
 <br>
For the moment, venture capitalists are putting most <br>
of their money into saving existing businesses, rather <br>
than starting new ones. According to data from <br>
VentureWire, a division of New York-based <br>
Technologic Partners, halfway through the fourth <br>
quarter, seed money and first-round financing <br>
accounted for just 12 percent of all disbursements, <br>
down from 25 percent in the first quarter.<br>

Smoking and life insurance<br>

Looking for a reason to quit smoking? It costs you <br>
money! We all know that purchasing cigarettes and <br>
cigars cost money, but you need to add the <br>
significantly higher cost to purchase life insurance to <br>
that expense.<br>

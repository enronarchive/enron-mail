Great to hear from you.  To be sure, it's jazz, not classical.  I've<br>
still got some growing to do.  I think of you every time I put on The<br>
Essential Stan Getz (sp?).  Great recommendation.  I've bought some Nina<br>
Simone lately -- most recently Best Of and Blues.  <br>
 <br>
I did see Run Lola Run -- great movie.  Haven't been going to the movies<br>
a lot lately b/c of Alex (my new son).  It's a fair trade though.  I'll<br>
pick up &quot;Momento&quot; next time I'm at Blockbuster, and check out the<br>
classical discs you recommended.  <br>
 <br>
Work is good -- I'm not sure if you know what we do -- we buy people out<br>
of their lp interests before the term of the partnership.  Esentially,<br>
providing liquidity to an otherwise illiquid market.  There's a lot of<br>
crap on the market these days, but every now and then you get someone<br>
selling good interest too.  It's mentally stimulating and professionally<br>
accretive, so I'm very happy.  Thanks again for the referral -- that was<br>
very helpful in making it all happen.<br>
 <br>
Well, I'll scan my recent disc purchases to see if there's any other<br>
buys I think you ought to put on your list.<br>
 <br>
All the best,<br>
Mark<br>

        Great to hear from you! The last few weeks have definitely been<br>
a difficult period. I still can't believe it. I'm doing fine and<br>
actually think that things areb eginning to stabilize. <br>
 <br>
        So, how's the baby doing? And how are you doing? John W. called<br>
about a week ago and said he thought you were doing well and seemed to<br>
be enjoying your new job (I guess it's not so new anymore). You<br>
definitely made the right decision to leaveS tratum. As you've probably<br>
heard, they haven't been able to raise any money and now plan to<br>
liquidate. I think they're down to four or five people in New York and<br>
about the same number in Houston. <br>
 <br>
        My address is as follows: 714 Camelot Lane, Houston, Texas<br>
77024. <br>
 <br>
        Again it's really good to hear from you. Best wishes. (Oh yeah,<br>
in case you haven't already seen the following movies, I highly<br>
recommend them: &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; (German with English subtitles) and<br>
&quot;Memento&quot; (American) - both are available on videotape.) (Also, if I<br>
remember correctly, you like classical music, so you mighte njoy Murray<br>
Perahia's (sp?) recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations.) Take care. <br>

Been thinking of you a lot lately.  I hope that you are well in light of<br>
all of the enron news.  <br>
<br>
I wanted to send you something via US mail.  I know that you bought a<br>
house about 1+ years ago, but I don't have your coordinates.  Can you<br>
send them along?<br>
<br>
Thanks, Bill. <br>

	Thanks for the e-mail and I look forward to meeting you too. I would prefer a laptop with a docking station. I would also prefer to keep the same phone number that I have now.  Thanks again.<br>

I wanted to introduce myself (I'm Drew Fossum's Assistant) and let you know I will be taking care of getting you moved to our group on October 22nd.  I have most of the information already from HR but I wanted to ask you if you prefer a desktop computer or laptop with a docking station and if you want to keep your same phone number?  I want to order a computer as soon as possible so you will have it when you move....Your new office location will be EB4788 (which we're hoping to have cleared out before the 22nd) in case you want to move some things before then.  I look forward to meeting you in person and if you have any questions, please feel free to call or email me.<br>
 <br>
Thanks,<br>

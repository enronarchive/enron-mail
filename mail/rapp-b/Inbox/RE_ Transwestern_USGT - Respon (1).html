I am ok with a summary (although I don't think it is as powerful of evidence, assuming the bids show we complied).  Out of curiosity, why are summaries better (or should I ask:  Whats wrong with the bids).  Greg<br>

I'm having faxed to each of you a summary that was prepared by Michelle Lokay of the bids that were received by third parties for the USGT capacity. I understand that the preference is to provide FERC with a summary rather than the actual bids. <br>

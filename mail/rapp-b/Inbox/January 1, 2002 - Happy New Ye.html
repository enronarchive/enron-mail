1. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
The decade ahead for e-business<br>
Sell-side solutions may be the wave of the near-term future<br>
<br>
By Steve Butler, senior analyst, eMarketer<br>
<br>
At the Line56 conference held recently in New York, one of the <br>
most upbeat perspectives on the future of e-business came from <br>
Tom Thomas, current CEO and chairman of Haht Commerce, and <br>
former CIO of Dell Computer (DELL) during the 1990s.<br>
<br>
Taking the long-term view of e-business over the next decade, <br>
Thomas compared the current economic climate in 2001 to that of <br>
1991--a time when the United States was in the middle of a <br>
recession, but at the beginning of a decade when the deployment <br>
of new technologies would bring immense opportunity for growth.<br>

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS<br>
Broadband goes mainstream<br>
That sound you hear may be media finally streaming and screaming <br>
through fat pipes<br>
<br>
By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist<br>
<br>
Who needs a race car when the local speed limits are 10 miles per hour? <br>
That was the lesson learned by many Internet-oriented business models <br>
that delivered services geared towards high-speed access, only to find <br>
that most surfers were still connected to the Web by a dowdy 56K dial-<br>
up modem. The promise of (high-speed) broadband connections has been <br>
so slow to materialize that many start-ups ran out of cash before ever <br>
garnering a large audience. Entire sectors, such as Web-based animation, <br>
have come and gone.<br>
<br>
But just as the hype has cooled, it now looks like the promise of <br>
broadband may finally be realized as we head into 2002. Penetration <br>
rates are rising again, and could soon reach the critical mass necessary to <br>
make broadband a mainstream technology. Roughly 10.7 million U.S. <br>
households now have broadband access, representing about 16 percent of <br>
all households online, according to research firm the Yankee Group. <br>
That's up some 60 percent from 12 months ago. <br>

Bill,  Please check with Greg and/or Drew as to their opinion. I'll be back in the office on Wednesday.  Let's discuss then and decide our approach.  I believe Jeff is still with Enron in San Francisco however I have not been able to reach him as I have left phonemail and e-mail messages for him on other subjects without response.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
Glen<br>

After reviewing the Pre-hearing conference statement, I feel that at this juncture all that may be needed is for TW to enter an appearance. I don't believe that we currently have a position as to &quot;whether PG&amp;E's proposed resolution of the issues raised by parties in their protests is agreeable&quot; such that we could file a statement as the judge has requested. Therfore, unless someone can summarize the parties positions and their impact on TW I would suggest that we use Jeff Dasovich to file an appearance for us since that would be the least costly alternative. If anyone has other suggestions please let me know.<br>

<br>
The CPUC has issued a Notice of the Prehearing Conference for PG&amp;E's Gas Accord II  filing to be held on January 7, 2002.  Prehearing conference statements are to be filed by January 2, 2002.  You may recall that the PG&amp;E filing in October was a request to simply extend their current rates for two additional years for the period of Jan. 1, 2003 through Dec. 31, 2004.  They based their request on the unresolved bankruptcy reorganization plan and uncertain gas markets.  <br>
<br>
Dan Douglas provided us a summary of the filing and my recollection is that after reviewing the filing and his summary we were of the opinion that the rate extension probably would have minimal impact on TW however their reorganization plan to convert their backbone system to an interstate pipeline via a filing at FERC could certainly have an impact.  In that regard, Jeff Dasovich has scheduled a conference call on January 8th with PG&amp;E to discuss their FERC filing and TW will be participating in that call.  <br>
<br>
Given our initial reaction to this filing, to what extent do we want to particiapate in this proceeding and do we want to use Dan?  At minimum we had intended to have Dan file a prehearing statement for us.  However given our cash concerns, before calling Dan I wanted to make sure we were still on the same track.  Below is the link to the Prehearing Notice.  gh<br>

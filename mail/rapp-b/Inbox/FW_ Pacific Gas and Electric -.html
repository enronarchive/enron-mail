<br>
In regard to the requests made by PG&amp;E and concern for their Transwestern exposure, the following is my proposed response. Please advise any comments or concerns.<br>
<br>
1. The prepayment mechanism remain while PG&amp;E remains in Bankruptcy. It is projected that they would emerge December 2002.<br>
<br>
2. Reject the request to post collateral to secure their Capacity Release transactions. We would offer that although TW is presently rated &quot;CC&quot; by the rating agencies we take exception to the rating and have initiated discussions regarding a review. If necessary we would offer the non public financials on TW based upon execution of a Confidentiality Agreement.<br>
<br>
3. Reject the request to post collateral as the Indemnification does not prescribe.<br>
<br>
I am planning to respond December 19.<br>
<br>
Regards.<br>
<br>

In regard to the issues below, I would propose the following responses. The reason for the email is I have received a followup message from Foley @PG&amp;E.<br>
<br>
1. PG&amp;E remain on prepay as long as they are operating in Chpt. 11<br>
<br>
2. I would decline on the posting of collateral on Capacity Release transactions. We disagree with the Rating Agencies on the downgrade. I would offer the Form 2 and Form 11 for their review and if PG&amp;E would be willing to execute a Confidentiality Agreement, we would provide the non public financials for their reassurance.Kevin Howard is in communication with the Agencies for a review.<br>
<br>
3. I would look for your direction on how to respond on the PCB issue.<br>
<br>
Also, I am planning on forwarding my responses internally so all will be aware in the event they are contacted by PG&amp;E.<br>
<br>
Thanks and Regards.<br>
<br>

My initial thoughts are that the prepayment requirement remain until PG &amp;E exits Bankruptcy.<br>

what goes around comes around.  I wondered how long it would take them to tell us to take the prepay and shove it up our ___.  Paul--any thoughts?<br>

 I received a call from Jack Foley from the PG&amp;E Credit Risk area regarding concerns to their exposure from TW. He cited that due to the' CC' S &amp; P rating they had concerns regarding their monthly prepayment to TW of approximately $ 1.8 M, our marketing of their excess capacity, and the Operating Agreement at the interconnect regarding indemnification of the PCB cleanup.<br>
He stated that PG&amp;E has exposure as a result of TW marketing their excess capacity which at present TW has paid PG &amp; E it's portion. However, we are due to remarket in January for their Spring/Summer capacity where we bill, collect and remit to PG &amp;E. Also, he advised that per the Operating Agreement at the interconnect, dated June 27, 1995, there is an indemnification for PCB cleanup and that we pay PG &amp; E $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 per year and the agreement runs to 2007. He added that there is a reaffirmation of the 1995 agreement dated May 28,1999, with Steve and Lou as the signers. <br>
<br>
In order to alleviate their concerns, Foley proposed, 1) TW drop the prepayment requirement and 2) provide security/collateral to secure the remarketing and PCB cleanup.<br>
<br>
Please review and advise your comments.<br>

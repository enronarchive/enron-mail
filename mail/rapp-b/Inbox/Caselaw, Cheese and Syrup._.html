  By late November folks aren't thinking about legal research, they're thinking about food. Our answer:<br>
<br>
--discount subscriptions to TheLaw.net for the month of November by up to 20%<br>
--send you something sharp and something sweet<br>
<br>
  Subscribe to TheLaw.net before the end of November and we'll immediately direct the farm families of the Cabot Creamery in Cabot, Vermont, to ship you a pint of their pure Vermont Maple Syrup and a pound of their Vintage Vermont Cheddar. See, http://www.cabotcheese.com<br>
see also http://www.thelaw.net/cabotoffer.htm<br>
<br>
<br>
…AND SAVE 20% ON THELAW.NET CONVENIENCE EDITION!<br>
<br>
  Just $395 (save $100!) on TheLaw.net Convenience Edition. TheLaw.net is a custom legal browser. It is very easy to use. $395 covers you for a year. You have unlimited access to everything. Install at work at home and on your laptop and feel-free to hand the software off to your trusted assistant at no extra charge. And did we mention there's a 30-day unconditional money back guarantee.<br>
<br>
  Our Small Office Special is on sale, too, and the prices for multi-user Workgroups look even more attractive. See, http://www.thelaw.net/subscribe.htm<br>
<br>
  Of course, our large competitors' databases have been a work in progress for generations. But, times have changed. A judicial opinion does not take on greater precedential value merely because it's fed to you via a WestLaw pipeline. It just costs more to read it. If you take a look at the searchable case law database you'll have UNLIMITED access to with TheLaw.net we stack up quite nicely, particularly when you consider the price.<br>
See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm<br>
 <br>
  By deploying TheLaw.net in your world you may discover that:<br>
<br>
----your online productivity increases ten fold<br>
----the list of expensive subscription items is much shorter<br>
----it makes sense to turn to the big guns only when you cannot otherwise find the answer elsewhere, faster, cheaper.<br>
<br>
  <br>
…UNRESOLVED MANAGEMENT ISSUES<br>
<br>
  Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues when it comes to choosing legal research resources?<br>
<br>
     --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?<br>
<br>
     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?<br>
<br>
     --Our subscribers snicker to themselves, click a checkbox to search all states or all Federal and they pay not one thin additional dime for the privilege. (See covered jurisdictions listed below the signature line.)<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I AM IN MY SWEATS DOING BILLABLE RESEARCH. I LOVE IT!&quot;<br>
<br>
     And there you have our new favorite quote, from a new subscriber leaving a large firm to start her own thing. We have others; lots of them. See, http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm<br>
<br>
     What's not to like?<br>

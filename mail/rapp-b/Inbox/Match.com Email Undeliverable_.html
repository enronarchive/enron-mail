IMPORTANT TIPS TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AT Match.com: <br>
<br>
If you use the &quot;reply&quot; button to respond to this message, please take the following steps:<br>
<br>
1.  DELETE ALL TEXT from the body of your message, including header information which may include your actual email address.<br>
<br>
2.  REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURES which may include your personal contact information.<br>
<br>
Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address (in the From: field), so that it will NOT appear in the &quot;From:&quot; line. However, DO NOT use the &quot;Cc:&quot; or &quot;Bcc:&quot; fields as these addresses CANNOT be stripped away.<br>
<br>
You may also contact this person from their Match.com profile by clicking &quot;Contact this person&quot; and composing your message directly from the site. <br>
<br>
Match.com does not monitor private email between members, nor are we liable for the content of these messages. All members are bound by our Match.com Service Agreement. <br>

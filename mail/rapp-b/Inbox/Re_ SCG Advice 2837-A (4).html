Dan,<br>
<br>
This is a follow up to our telephone conversation of this<br>
afternoon. The attachment, which apparently originated with you, is what<br>
we will talk about during our conference call at 8:00 a.m. (California<br>
time) on Monday. Thanks.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; After discussing with Lynn and Glen, we think that we would like to<br>
&gt; file comments in this proceeding concerning an issue we have had since<br>
&gt; this has been implemented on Nov 1.  In instances where SoCal happens<br>
&gt; to call their OFO in the Intraday 2 cycle, it can cause Transwestern<br>
&gt; to have Shipper imbalances because we do not have an opportunity to<br>
&gt; pass-along these reductions to our upstream parties.  We think we<br>
&gt; would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of<br>
&gt; the &quot;direction&quot; of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that<br>
&gt; has developed since actual implementation that we are currently<br>
&gt; working on with them.  Lynn &amp; I worked on this rough general<br>
&gt; description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &quot;If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an<br>
&gt; allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process<br>
&gt; with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable<br>
&gt; to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Lynn thinks if we are unable to resolve this issue with SoCal, TW<br>
&gt; could have high Shipper imbalance exposure.<br>

&gt; Lindy , can you please take a look at this and let me know if we<br>
&gt; should file comments. Thanks. You might see if Glen has looked at it<br>
&gt; yet.<br>

&gt; The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the<br>
&gt; changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by<br>
&gt; AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal<br>
&gt; receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and<br>
&gt; to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating<br>
&gt; procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in<br>
&gt; anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable<br>
&gt; intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR)<br>
&gt; proceeding, I.99-07-003.<br>
&gt; During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that<br>
&gt; SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a<br>
&gt; better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point<br>
&gt; capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015<br>
&gt; directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing<br>
&gt; information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August<br>
&gt; 6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the<br>
&gt; Commission.<br>
&gt; Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have<br>
&gt; convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing<br>
&gt; operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum<br>
&gt; operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making<br>
&gt; these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.<br>
&gt; SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and<br>
&gt; with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding<br>
&gt; the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the<br>
&gt; days leading up to the meetings.<br>
&gt; Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good<br>
&gt; weekend!<br>

What Enron Did Right<br>

  This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the<br>
vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires),<br>
competition (Lucent, AT&amp;T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and<br>
dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being<br>
an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from<br>
grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.<br>
<br>
   Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron<br>
became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor<br>
of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles<br>
drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements<br>
were all a mirage.<br>
   We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under<br>
investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts<br>
of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the<br>
law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve<br>
themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an<br>
enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.<br>
<br>
<br>
   -- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and<br>
electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open<br>
market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to<br>
enter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business.<br>
<br>
   Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S.,<br>
and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have<br>
been consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen<br>
competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The<br>
contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would<br>
re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough<br>
deregulation.<br>
<br>
<br>
   -- Innovation and the &quot;de-integration&quot; of power contracts. Under the<br>
old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were<br>
offered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system<br>
was inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you<br>
can only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that<br>
could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer.<br>
<br>
   To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its<br>
constituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc.,<br>
and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's<br>
investors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by<br>
inventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph<br>
Schumpeter called the &quot;process of Creative Destruction.&quot; But creative<br>
destroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be<br>
part of Enron's problem today.<br>
<br>
<br>
   -- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended<br>
the logic of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper<br>
company, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper<br>
plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run<br>
all those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms.<br>
Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with<br>
inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of<br>
&quot;customers&quot; and &quot;suppliers.&quot; Enron envisioned creating free markets for<br>
components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-market<br>
terms would be better than those of the internal operations. The<br>
development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions<br>
of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the<br>
economy.<br>
<br>
<br>
   -- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated<br>
environment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a<br>
single dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could<br>
be supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer to<br>
the benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of<br>
alternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controlling<br>
switches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the molecules<br>
or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use,<br>
and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. This<br>
policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous value<br>
for both customers and suppliers.<br>
<br>
<br>
   -- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could<br>
easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of<br>
the trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal<br>
controls. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we<br>
judge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of<br>
Enron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billion<br>
each day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information on<br>
company-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver.<br>
<br>
   The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading<br>
losses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's<br>
ability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and<br>
trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite,<br>
counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the<br>
erosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.<br>
<br>
<br>
   -- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's<br>
corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood<br>
stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal,<br>
slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline<br>
company -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron<br>
became bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It<br>
bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to<br>
start new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm.<br>
<br>
   Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and<br>
an open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization<br>
and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe<br>
the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs.<br>
This was a lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could<br>
serve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.<br>
<br>
   Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the<br>
transformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet<br>
corners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in<br>
almost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.<br>
<br>
   The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&amp;D<br>
establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover<br>
following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and<br>
time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to<br>
find a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all<br>
should hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to<br>
reinvent themselves and remake their industries.<br>

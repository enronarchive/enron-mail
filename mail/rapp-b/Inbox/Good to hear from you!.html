Good morning -<br>
<br>
I am glad that things have started to stabilize at Enron.  On the side <br>
lines, we still have our fingers crossed for all of you.<br>
<br>
Thanks for asking about Caleb.  He did not/has not gotten pneumonia yet but <br>
it has been a struggle.  He does not respond to cough medicine at all, in <br>
fact it makes him worse.  What I finally got the hang of is using Vicks <br>
Vapor Rub.  Other than feeling great, I really had no idea that it could <br>
work wonders so at least I have gotten to add new &quot;remedy&quot; info to my list <br>
&lt;g&gt;.<br>
<br>
I am still hoping that we can get together before Christmas.  I don't know <br>
what your schedule is this week but mine should start to loosen up towards <br>
the end.  You aren't open for Friday are you?<br>
<br>
Regardless, it was really good to hear from you and thanks for keeping us in <br>
your thoughts.<br>
<br>
Lili<br>
<br>
P.S.  I am sending this to your work address but will be careful not to use <br>
too often.<br>
<br>

&gt;Lili,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;     I just wanted to drop you a note and see how your son's doing. <br>
&gt;Hopefully, he's improved. And I hope that things are going well for you, <br>
&gt;too.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;     Things have actually stabilized at Enron and I think we'll  begin to <br>
&gt;see improvement in the weeks ahead. It's still weird coming to work each <br>
&gt;day to a half-empty building.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;     If I don't speak to you before then, have a great Christmas. Take <br>
&gt;care.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>

Bill,<br>
<br>
I hope your new job is treating you well.  Sorry to bother you but I had two more questions regarding Starwood that I am hoping you can answer.  They both regard the DSM projects.<br>
<br>
1. If Starwood chooses not to use their own capital for DSM projects, is EES obliged to provide lease financing?<br>
<br>
2. Related to the above, if we are obliged, are we limited in the rate we can charge?  i.e. Could we charge a &quot;discouraging&quot; rate?  The language in the MLA Section 2.2 seems to be adequately vague that if we were having trouble raising capital ourselves, we could pass those costs through as &quot;such other factors as are customarily considered by lessor parties providing lease financing for similar equipment and terms.&quot;  <br>
<br>
These questions came up when RAC looked at our summary documentation.  I am hoping these are quick questions for you.  Please let me know.<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
Chris<br>

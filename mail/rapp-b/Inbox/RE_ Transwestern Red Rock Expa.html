Bill,<br>

Thanks for including me.  I have no further comments or suggestions.  In fact I like the idea of requesting an extension versus deleting this portion of the project and reducing our capability to contract the remaining capacity that Station 4 provides.  Hopefully the market will step up and need this capacity prior to 2003.  Thanks again.  <br>

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.<br>

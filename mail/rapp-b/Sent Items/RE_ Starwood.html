The amendment that I think you're referring to was not signed. We sent it to Starwood and then nothing happened. If you can't find a hard copy, you can call Rell Tipton at V&amp;E and ask him to e-mail you the latest version of the Starwood amendment that he's been working on. If you can't reach Rell, his assistant, Birdie Cortinas can probably help. Rell's number is (713)758-4506. Hope this helps.<br>

Hi, Bill.  Sorry to bother you again.  I found four original amendments in Travis' office, but what I am looking for is the Amendment to the CMA that pertains to the Offer Period.  Do you recall the one I am talking about?  Did it ever get signed?  <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

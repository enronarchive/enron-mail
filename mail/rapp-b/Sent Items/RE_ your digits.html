Mark,<br>

        Great to hear from you! The last few weeks have definitely been a difficult period. I still can't believe it. I'm doing fine and actually think that things are beginning to stabilize. <br>
 <br>
        So, how's the baby doing? And how are you doing? John W. called about a week ago and said he thought you were doing well and seemed to be enjoying your new job (I guess it's not so new anymore). You definitely made the right decision to leave Stratum. As you've probably heard, they haven't been able to raise any money and now plan to liquidate. I think they're down to four or five people in New York and about the same number in Houston. <br>
 <br>
        My address is as follows: 714 Camelot Lane, Houston, Texas 77024. <br>
 <br>
        Again it's really good to hear from you. Best wishes. (Oh yeah, in case you haven't already seen the following movies, I highly recommend them: &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; (German with English subtitles) and &quot;Memento&quot; (American) - both are available on videotape.) (Also, if I remember correctly, you like classical music, so you might enjoy Murray Perahia's (sp?) recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations.) Take care. <br>

Been thinking of you a lot lately.  I hope that you are well in light of all of the enron news.  <br>
<br>
I wanted to send you something via US mail.  I know that you bought a house about 1+ years ago, but I don't have your coordinates.  Can you send them along?<br>
<br>
Thanks, Bill. <br>

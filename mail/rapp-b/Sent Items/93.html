	Since I haven't heard back from you re the e-mail I sent earlier this week, I assume that you're going to pass on the Nutcracker. Although I'm disappointed, I guess it's better to know this now rather than further down the road.<br>
<br>
	Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed meeting you and talking with you. You're a very, very nice person. So, I hope you find the person you're looking for. Take care and best wishes for you and your family. Happy Holidays!<br>
<br>

Rob and I had fun in CS.  Yes, the Ags need to get better.  This weekend<br>
should be a huge test.<br>
<br>
Mo and I would like to go to the Braden reunion but I seem to have misplaced<br>
my invite.  Can you sign us up?  I'm not sure what are plan will be (I think<br>
Mo has a running event on Saturday morning of the 20th) but we'll talk next<br>
week.<br>

Hi John, I'm glad the ags won but did they look good?  We need to get<br>
better, yes!!!  Are you and Mo planning on coming to the Braden reunion on<br>
Sunday 21st?  Granddad is treating but we're trying to determine how many.<br>
Let me know.  Have a great week.  We will stay home this weekend in our own<br>
beds:)  Love, Mom<br>

&gt;Hey guys, I got your phone message.  There hasn't been any change to my<br>
&gt;e-mail so no telling what happened.  How is everything going?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;For us, work is work and in between is eat and sleep.  At least that's what<br>
&gt;it feels like sometimes.  I'm off to College Station this weekend with Rob<br>
&gt;to watch the Aggs play.  Talk to you soon.<br>
&gt;<br>

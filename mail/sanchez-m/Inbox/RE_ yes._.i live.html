   Sorry I haven't gotten back to you before now and I truly wish we<br>
   could've<br>
   gotten together over Memorial Day.  I was only in town a couple of days<br>
   and<br>
   then off to San Antonio so we just missed each other again.  Go a lot to<br>
   catch up on and I am going to be tenacious in my attempts to get a hold<br>
   of<br>
   you...let me know when you have time to talk.  I am out this weekend but<br>
   maybe tonight or next week, we can chat.  Let me know.<br>
<br>
   Take care and stay safe.<br>
<br>

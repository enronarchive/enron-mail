Yes I got it - and i love it.  It brought a tear to my eye!!  My goodness -<br>
your life sounds like it has become very exciting - not that it ever<br>
sounded<br>
dull. . . Yes - we would love to go skiing sometime!!  We are always up for<br>
that and would certainly wait until John has his knees under him again.  I<br>
WILL call you this weekend.  We must catch up.  I am also looking into<br>
coming to Houston sometime.  I arranged for a conference there earlier in<br>
April, but before I could call to see if you would be there, I decided that<br>
things at work were too hectic and I couldn't spare the time away from the<br>
office.<br>
<br>
I SO look forward to talking with you!!<br>
<br>
Have a wonderful evening.  So, is it Survivor or Friends?<br>

<br>
Hey there...i'm trying to send you this thing again....it just really<br>
reminded me of us in college.  Let me know if it still doesn't work.<br>
<br>
As for me..still no wedding plans.  Your recap of life in armadillo sounds<br>
exactly like our life in houston...work,eat,sleep,work,eat,sleep....kind of<br>
depressing...I often feel we are ships passing in the night and not<br>
romantic little newlyweds.  But we managed to take a vacation in park city<br>
a month ago..learned to snowboard which was a blast.  We also have a longer<br>
trip planned in June to go to Alaska which I think will be good medicine<br>
for the day to day grind.  My job is going very well.  I am trading gas now<br>
for enron and trading that crazy california market you probably hear about<br>
on the news...very exciting and the group is very fun.  I've been able to<br>
do a lot of travelling as part of the perks of the job.  I went to portland<br>
in jan and skied for the first time in my adult life...absolutely loved it<br>
and booked a trip BY MYSELF (yes...by myself) a month later in park city.<br>
It was great.  Lots of time to myself and a great looking private ski<br>
instructor for 4hrs a day.  A few weeks ago I went to the Cayman Islands<br>
with my group....and couple of us are going to vegas this weekend.  I also<br>
went to south beach a month ago with a broker i do business with in newyork<br>
(we have to go there...definitely a girls trip).  Then lastly I'll be going<br>
to the kentucky derby next month....So basically this has been like some<br>
huge dream I haven't woken up from yet.  Unfortunately all this play comes<br>
at the wrong time in my life...this is the life to have when you are right<br>
out of college...not settling down...But oh well,,,I am definitely taking<br>
advantage of it knowing that in due time things will slow down.<br>
<br>
John is liking his job and doing well. Still a sweetheart. We are looking<br>
at early 2003 for possible relocation from TX.  At this moment I hope to be<br>
able to transfer to our Portland office and trade power..but more<br>
importantly live in what I think is the most beautiful state in the US.<br>
We'll see though...things certainly change with time and it is easy to keep<br>
pushing off something major like that......I'm still shocked that I am<br>
still in houston. Unfortunately and fortunately I really like my job right<br>
now (finally).<br>
<br>
The dogs are well...growing up fast.  Bought a harness for Jake and w/ john<br>
on a skateboard and me on blades..we were pulled down the block at<br>
lightening speed chasing after a standard poodle last night.  It was<br>
hilarious.<br>
<br>
What else,,,what else.....I am done w/ c school...i did a program that was<br>
equivalent to 1/2 a culinary degree.  I was working at a restaurant after<br>
that on saturdays and a bakery occasionally..but with this new job...i gave<br>
those things up and hardly have the time to cook and bake..though i do fit<br>
it in every once in a while.<br>
<br>
Anyway...we should really see eachother in person.  You name the weekend<br>
and I will fly up to armadillo...i am serious...and of course you are<br>
always more than welcome to come here.  It doesn't matter to me.  Also..if<br>
you and Tom want to plan any sort of ski vacation next season and need<br>
people...LET ME KNOW. I plan to do a tremendous amount of that next year.<br>
I think John might have knee surgery in September...so for the 2 of us to<br>
go....February would be best or after.....we could always go to canada..I<br>
would love to go there.<br>
<br>
My family is doing well...though my gma is getting very old and slow...very<br>
sad.  My mom takes care of her when she is not working and it has been<br>
wearing on her as well. Not just to give the care...but just to see her<br>
grow old.  Makes me sad...something though that I think most families are<br>
having to deal with.  I have 2 nephews and one niece.  I can't imagine with<br>
my current job situation and possible move to Portland..when we would have<br>
kids...though I really want to...it just sucks..it's such an either or<br>
situation career wise.  I don't want to have our kids raised by a sitter or<br>
a nanny if we can avoid it.  AUgh!  Sometimes I feel like I could just<br>
choke on all the pressure/anxiety I sometimes feel about the whole thing.<br>
I've said before that I feel like age 30 is just this big wall where I have<br>
to accomplish all these things before I get there..and then BAM have kids.<br>
I just don't feel there yet..but I don't want to keep pushing the wall<br>
back. AUGh!  I'm sure we could rap a lot on this subject...which is why we<br>
should get together.  Like I said.  Name the date.<br>
<br>
John and I have cell phones not a home phone.  Mine is 713-516-0651.  John<br>
is 832-724-7102.  You can also call me anytime (though afternoons are much<br>
much better) at work at 713-853-1917.  I'm looking forward to talking to<br>
you soon and hearing more about your job and how things are going.<br>
<br>
Again..let me know if this thing below is unreadable...I will fax it to<br>
you.<br>
Take care,<br>
Love-MO<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; IT MAKES YOU THINK<br>
&gt; Sometime in between moving into<br>
&gt; the dorm,<br>
&gt; And begging for an ID,<br>
&gt; Somewhere in the middle of an 8<br>
&gt; o'clock class,<br>
&gt; And watching Friends on our 8 inch<br>
&gt; TV.<br>
&gt; Sometime after the night you<br>
&gt; forgot,<br>
&gt; With the guy you don't remember.<br>
&gt; Maybe before the five tests in<br>
&gt; three days,<br>
&gt; Or the party every night in<br>
&gt; September.<br>
&gt; Sometime in the car on the way to<br>
&gt; Daytona,<br>
&gt; For the road-trip of the year.<br>
&gt; After class gets out with that gay<br>
&gt; TA,<br>
&gt; After you finish the last warm<br>
&gt; beer.<br>
&gt; Shortly after you figured out,<br>
&gt; This newfangled 'e-mail' thing.<br>
&gt; And after you stopped dreaming<br>
&gt; about,<br>
&gt; The fun a 21 ID would bring.<br>
&gt; Maybe the morning after you pulled<br>
&gt; the all-nighter,<br>
&gt; But finally got the paper done,<br>
&gt; Or maybe when you can't remember,<br>
&gt; The last Sunday night you had fun.<br>
&gt; Somewhere between the day you met<br>
&gt; your dorm roommate,<br>
&gt; And you were sure you got one of<br>
&gt; the duds,<br>
&gt; And the day 4 years later when<br>
&gt; she's still your roommate,<br>
&gt; And she's one of your best buds.<br>
&gt; Definitely after you realized how<br>
&gt; lucky you are,<br>
&gt; To have such a great group of<br>
&gt; friends,<br>
&gt; And after you get that sick<br>
&gt; feeling in you stomach,<br>
&gt; Wondering what will happen when it<br>
&gt; ends.<br>
&gt; Maybe on the beach for spring<br>
&gt; break,<br>
&gt; Hot sun, tan bodies, cold beer.<br>
&gt; Maybe after you started looking<br>
&gt; for a job,<br>
&gt; And your happy world turned to<br>
&gt; fear.<br>
&gt; Soon after you discovered there's<br>
&gt; just not enough time,<br>
&gt; To do everything you should.<br>
&gt; But not before you realized<br>
&gt; Thanksgiving dinner,<br>
&gt; Never tasted so good.<br>
&gt; Sometime after the day your<br>
&gt; parents came to visit,<br>
&gt; So you were forced to make your<br>
&gt; bed.<br>
&gt; Or the morning after a tough night<br>
&gt; at the bars,<br>
&gt; And you can't believe the things<br>
&gt; you said.<br>
&gt; Sometime after you enjoy the<br>
&gt; beautiful weather,<br>
&gt; Though it means missing a class.<br>
&gt; &gt;Probably after laughing on<br>
&gt; Homecoming weekend,<br>
&gt; Watching old alumni drunk off<br>
&gt; their collective ass.<br>
&gt; Somewhere between day one and year<br>
&gt; four,<br>
&gt; The best years of your life were<br>
&gt; spent.<br>
&gt; And looking back with a smile and<br>
&gt; a sigh,<br>
&gt; You wonder where those years went.<br>
&gt; You try to figure out who made you<br>
&gt; a victim,<br>
&gt; Of the most serious crime,<br>
&gt; You offer a reward for any<br>
&gt; information leading,<br>
&gt; To the one who stole the time.<br>
&gt; The day is coming closer, and<br>
&gt; closer,<br>
&gt; Until one day it will be your<br>
&gt; last,<br>
&gt; And someone is guilty of doing<br>
&gt; this to you,<br>
&gt; The years have gone way too fast.<br>
&gt; Sometime when you were too busy to<br>
&gt; notice,<br>
&gt; Happy as a newborn pup,<br>
&gt; Someone came along and did the<br>
&gt; unthinkable.<br>
&gt; Somebody grew us up.<br>
<br>

It's only taken me 6 months to reply - I've been meaning to write you back<br>
and tell you that my attachment didn't open!!<br>
<br>
I was at home a few weeks ago and figured that you probably had broken down<br>
and gotten a normal telephone with a listed number by now, but I was wrong.<br>
I will not gloss over the fact that I have failed miserably as the friend<br>
of<br>
a newly engaged person in that I have not been seeking regular updates from<br>
you on the progress of everything.  Also, I generally wonder how you are<br>
doing outside of that pre-marital thing.<br>
<br>
Have you determined a time frame for the marriage?  Location - Houston vs.<br>
Bali??<br>
How is work going?<br>
Are you still taking culinary classes?<br>
Is John still with the Canadian company, or at least the company that does<br>
a<br>
lot of work in Canada?<br>
How is your Grandma?  Mother?<br>
Jake?<br>
<br>
Things here in Armadillo are status quo.  We just work, sleep, eat, work,<br>
sleep, eat, eat some more, and occasionally do things with the few couple<br>
friends we have in town.  Pretty boring life, but it keeps up too damn<br>
busy.<br>
It's all perspective, I suppose.<br>
<br>
I miss you terribly and hope that you can describe for me what I was<br>
supposed to be able to open as an attachment.  I'm not sure why it didn't<br>
work.<br>
<br>
Take care, and I look forward to talking with you soon!!!<br>
Kristi<br>

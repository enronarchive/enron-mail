I am soooo sorry I am not able to watch them for you.  I feel bad because I<br>
said I could.<br>
I just didn't plan on all of this going on at the same time as your trip.<br>
Yall are going to have<br>
a blast!    The 10th is right around the corner.<br>
<br>
I got a loan through Countrywide.  It is a good deal because I am going<br>
with a no income/no asset loan.  Basically I don't disclose any of that<br>
information.  I have to pay a higher rate because of it but it is the<br>
easiest way for me to qualify.  Especially since the down payment is not<br>
coming from my own funds.  But the rate isn't that bad because Countrywide<br>
will pay a point for me since I have been here over a year.  It's just a<br>
matter of finding the house I want.<br>
I will let you know as soon as I get a signed contract.  Then you can come<br>
to my house warming party!!  = )<br>
<br>
The truck should be here anyday now.  I am very excited.  I feel like I<br>
have waited forever!!  You remember when I first started talking about it<br>
back in Dec of 2000.  That was a year and a half ago!!  Now I finally get<br>
it.  Yipppppeeee!!!<br>
<br>
The dogs are good.  I took Cookie and Tyson home for Mother's Day weekend.<br>
Lucy and Tyson played like crazy!!<br>
Mike fell in love with him.  He wants them both.  hee hee.  He is bringing<br>
Lucy up to Dallas soon and I get to keep her for SIX MONTHS!!  That is<br>
going to be insane.  (and alot of doodie too!!!)  But I know she will be<br>
happy.  They all got along fine in San Antonio.  Oh, and Tyson LOVES<br>
Cookie.  He licks her ears and eyes all the time.  And then she licks him<br>
back.  It is really cute.<br>
<br>
When do I get to see you???????????<br>
MIss you,<br>

I got back form Germany on Friday and have been trying to catch up with<br>
work<br>
before our trip to Alaska.  We leave this Sunday the 10th.  Monique's<br>
brother is going to watch the dogs while we're gone so don't worry about<br>
it.<br>
It sounds like you've got your hands full.<br>
<br>
It's great you're buying a house.  We just can't seem to figure out what we<br>
want to do.  Monique is so stressed out with work right now I'm not sure<br>
how<br>
much longer we'll be in Houston.<br>
<br>
Did you get a good loan?  Did you get your truck yet?<br>

Hi Worm,<br>
<br>
How's it going?  I haven't heard from you in awhile!!<br>
What are the dates you are going to Alaska?<br>
Did Mom tell you I am buying a house?<br>
Well, I am.   And it is stressing me out!!!!!<br>
I have two offers on the table right now.<br>
Both of the houses are cute.  I just can't decide which one<br>
I like better.  You need to come visit soon.  Hopefully,<br>
I will be moved in when you bring Jake and Pearl up.<br>
How is Mo?  How is work?  How are the dogs?<br>
Let me know.<br>
Love,<br>
Jul<br>

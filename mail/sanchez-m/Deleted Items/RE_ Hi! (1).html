I got back form Germany on Friday and have been trying to catch up with work<br>
before our trip to Alaska.  We leave this Sunday the 10th.  Monique's<br>
brother is going to watch the dogs while we're gone so don't worry about it.<br>
It sounds like you've got your hands full.<br>
<br>
It's great you're buying a house.  We just can't seem to figure out what we<br>
want to do.  Monique is so stressed out with work right now I'm not sure how<br>
much longer we'll be in Houston.<br>
<br>
Did you get a good loan?  Did you get your truck yet?<br>

Hi Worm,<br>
<br>
How's it going?  I haven't heard from you in awhile!!<br>
What are the dates you are going to Alaska?<br>
Did Mom tell you I am buying a house?<br>
Well, I am.   And it is stressing me out!!!!!<br>
I have two offers on the table right now.<br>
Both of the houses are cute.  I just can't decide which one<br>
I like better.  You need to come visit soon.  Hopefully,<br>
I will be moved in when you bring Jake and Pearl up.<br>
How is Mo?  How is work?  How are the dogs?<br>
Let me know.<br>
Love,<br>
Jul<br>

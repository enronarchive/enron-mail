Indeed I am whipping up a meal for a li'l  lady.  I think I'll just go ahead and buy a pyrex, I should probly have  one, thanks though.  I'm not quite sure how it came to be this way, but I'm  doing it at my house instead of hers.  So I have a HUGE chore to prepare  the casa before tomorrow night.  I've already banished Nels to Tatia's  place.<br>
 <br>
Ah yes, the brewery picture.  Boy did I  feel B-A-D bad that day!  I really had JUST woken up for that.  Ya,  maybe Friday, we can keep in touch.<br>

Yo!<br>
Yes, I believe your typical campells will have little  mushroom pieces in<br>
it.  And kmart would be a good place to buy a pyrex  dish (glass<br>
baking)....of course you could borrow any supplies from me any  time.  Are<br>
you cooking up some grub for a lil lady???<br>
I heard you  all had a great time.  Saw the pic of you that john said you<br>
&quot;woke up&quot;  for at the brewery.  Maybe we all can get together for a brew<br>
before  john and i are off for alaska on sunday.  we will be gone for a  week<br>
and a half.  Maybe friday after work.<br>
Let me know if you have  any other cooking q's.<br>

   Hey Momar.  Did you have a  peaceful week?  We had a blast.  I've got a<br>
    couple of Q's for ya.  Does cream of mushroom soup have actual  mushroom<br>
   pieces in it?  And where would  be a good  place to buy a glass<br>
   baking/casserole  dish?<br>
   Thanks,<br>
    Robbie<br>

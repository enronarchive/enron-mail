 <br>
&gt;MORE THAN SPEEDING?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;A police officer  pulls a guy over for speeding and has the  following<br>
&gt;exchange:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Officer: May I see your driver's  license?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Driver: I don't have one. I had it suspended when I  got my 5th DUI.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Officer: May I see the owner's card for this  vehicle?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Driver: It's not my car. I stole  it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Officer: The car is stolen?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Driver: That's  right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's<br>
&gt;card in the  glove box when I was putting my gun in there.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Officer:  There's a gun in the glove box?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Driver: Yes sir. That's where  I put it after I shot and killed the woman<br>
&gt;who owns this car and  stuffed her in the trunk.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Officer: There's a BODY in the  TRUNK?!?!?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Driver: Yes, sir.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Hearing this, the  officer immediately called his captain. The car was<br>
&gt;quickly  surrounded by police, and the captain approached the driver<br>
&gt;to handle  the tense situation:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Captain: Sir, can I see your  license?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Driver: Sure. Here it is.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;It was  valid.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Captain: Who's car is this?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Driver:  It's mine, officer. Here's the owner' card.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The driver owned  the car.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I  can see if there's<br>
&gt;a gun in it?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Driver: Yes, sir, but  there's no gun in it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Sure enough, there was nothing in the  glove box.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was  told you said<br>
&gt;there's a body in it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Driver: No  problem.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Trunk is opened; no body.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Captain: I  don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you<br>
&gt;told him  you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the<br>
&gt;glovebox,  and that there was a dead body in the trunk.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Driver: Yeah,  I'll bet he told you I was speeding,  too.<br>

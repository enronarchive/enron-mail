        Weekend Update: Go easy on yourself and others Friday. Set aside tight schedules and worries. Take things as they come, without getting bogged down in impossible expectations. Delays and adjustments are very likely. Saturday is excellent for making sense out of Friday's events. Calmly piece together fragments until they assume some sort of order. It is so important that you consciously forgive those who have disappointed or inconvenienced you or your loved ones. Hanging onto resentment will tear holes in your heart. Sunday brings bliss. Doubt is replaced with a comforting sense that all will be fine in time. Private talks with loved ones bring healing and emotional intimacy. In fact, you may experience a gratifying breakthrough in one of your most important relationships. Encourage your significant other to relax, dream, and cultivate hope. Things will evolve in wondrous ways. Graciously accept the unasked for changes entering your life and let the transformation begin. . . .    	<br>

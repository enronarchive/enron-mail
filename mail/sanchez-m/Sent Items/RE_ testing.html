I'm glad you remembered my email.  Glad to see you too.  Now that I have your email you are sure to get the invite for next years partyI actually ran into Anthony Magdaleno about 2 weeks ago.  Do you know him?  He was in the same volunteer group w/ Monica and I.<br>
I think we are going to meet up at woodrows again this friday.  I like the location....and some different faces as well as opposed to the kirby crowd.<br>
I work on the west gas trading desk here at enron....if you have friends who work in gas as well, perhaps i know them.  Of course this place is like A&amp;M....huge.  Take care and hopefully we'll see each other out again. Say hello to Monica for me.  Maybe we can meet up sometime after work for drinks.<br>

2-12&quot; cakes may work ok but you might swap the positions about half way<br>
through the cooking time.I'm pretty sure it will take longer than the<br>
prescribed time but it will work. To acurately test them,touch the top of<br>
each layer.If the finger marks bounce back you're there.If they remain<br>
indented.bake a little longer.Perhaps 2 minutes at a time.If you have any<br>
pressing issues call my cell(713-725-2676) Good luck    Den<br>

&gt; Made the ganache last night...tastes great...do you glaze it on the cake<br>
or<br>
&gt; frost the cake?  It said frosting..but to me it looked glazeable.<br>
&gt; Ran to make a cake during lunch to pick up last few things.  What do you<br>
&gt; think about baking 2 12x2 cakes in one oven at the same time...staggering<br>
&gt; the pans?  I was wondering if it wouldn't bring down the oven temp because<br>
&gt; it might interfere with the air circulation in the oven.  Oh well...not<br>
&gt; sure what I'm going to do.  My plan is to bake the cakes tonight.<br>
&gt; Everything is already measured.  I am crossing my fingers that my oven<br>
&gt; doesn't wig out.....last night it did when i was making<br>
financiers.......my<br>
&gt; oven is very temperamental...though it has been good lately.  Talk to you<br>
&gt; soon.<br>

&gt; Question:<br>
&gt; For the engine cake do you use the recipe for the ganache on there or a<br>
&gt; different one?<br>
&gt; I was planning on trying their recipe.<br>
&gt; Tonight i'm going to measure out everything.  I'll keep you updated.<br>

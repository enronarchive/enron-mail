Hey,<br>
<br>
Yes, I tried calling on Saturday night but you must have already been mint<br>
juleped (if that is a verb...you tell me?)  I actually did not make it down<br>
this weekend...forgot it was Mother's Day so I stayed here and did the<br>
brunch thing with Mom and Grandma in Connecticut, will be coming down on<br>
Memorial Day Weekend so maybe we can say hello then.<br>
<br>
I'll try calling you this weekend anyway and we can swap our relationship<br>
stories.  Glad you had a good time in Kentucky and you made it home safely.<br>
Talk to you soon...promise.<br>
<br>

Hey there,<br>
<br>
Did you call me at the Derby?  I have some vague recollection of getting a<br>
voice mail from you...however i had many many mint juleps and was very<br>
intoxicated.  I actually flew in on saturday and out sunday morning....was<br>
maybe there 16hrs tops.<br>
Anyway,  I guess you were here this weekend.  Hope everything went well.<br>
Give me a call anytime if you'd like to talk.  I will be home solo for the<br>
next 3 weekends....great time to chit chat.  Hopefully will talk to you<br>
soon.<br>
Take care,<br>
Mo.<br>

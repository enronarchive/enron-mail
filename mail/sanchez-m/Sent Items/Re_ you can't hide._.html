We should talk soon and it actually won't be that long before I come into<br>
town again.  I'll be down the weekend of May 12 that Thursday night and<br>
nothing would make me happier than to spend a chunk of the afternoon at The<br>
Ale House again.  A few beers always helps these kinds of conversations<br>
because they are difficult emotional things to think about and that is best<br>
done if you are willing to let your guard down.  I have been thinking a lot<br>
about my relationship and what it means to me and I would love to share if<br>
you are willing to listen.  You haven't slowed the traveling down at all I<br>
see...all I claim in terms of travel are weekly trips to lovely suburban<br>
New Jersey.  Enjoy the Derby (if it wasn't this past weekend and I'll talk<br>
to you soon)<br>
<br>
peace, love and flowers<br>

Hey there,<br>
I would love to have more deep conversations on these topics.  Maybe we can<br>
schedule a long phone call sometime since i'm sure it will be a while<br>
before you come in.  I am so bad about answering my phone in the<br>
evenings...i just shut down shop when i go home....but we should definitely<br>
talk.  I'm interested in hearing about you as well.  From our talk last<br>
time it seems we may have some of the same dilemmas.  I've got a trip<br>
coming up to the Kentucky derby next weekend...was in vegas last<br>
weekend....but will be around here until mid june when john and I go to<br>
alaska.  I am slightly ready to slow down now...way too much travel...john<br>
and i need to spend more quality time together.  I don't know how you do<br>
the long distance relationship..it would be very hard for me.  I guess I<br>
crave more constant attention--high maintenance---Ha!  Kidding.  Anyway, it<br>
is always great to hear from you.  Hopefully we can talk soon.<br>
Take care,<br>
Mo.<br>

How the hell is my globe-trotting, beach combing, vacation taking, cake<br>
baking, food preparing, favorite Enron employee?  I promised i wasn't going<br>
to let you go another 12 months before i talked to you again and i'm<br>
keeping my word.  We have a lot still to talk about in line with the<br>
conversation we had at the Ale House...you know, good times, good friends,<br>
good beer and deep conversation about love, career, marriage and what we do<br>
with our lives.  Respond when you can and I hope all is well with you.<br>
<br>
Talk to you soon,<br>
<br>

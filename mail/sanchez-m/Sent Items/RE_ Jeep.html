Just spoke with Rebecca...the guys wife.  She says he has a grandfather clock repair tonight to do....not sure if 7 will work.  I told her we had just wanted to check it out while it was still daylight outside.  She is going to phone her hubby and get back with me.  I also gave her your name and cell phone.  She said that this truck is her husbands &quot;baby&quot; and it is breaking his heart to get rid.  Thats a good sign.  I'll talk to you later.<br>

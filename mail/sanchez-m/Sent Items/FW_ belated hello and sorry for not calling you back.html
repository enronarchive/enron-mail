I really wanted to spend some time talking with you this past weekend but<br>
with the bachelor party I was involved with, it was impossible to fit it<br>
in.  And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels.  The<br>
most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun and<br>
you always have intelligent things to say.  At a different level, I think<br>
you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value you<br>
what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm very<br>
good at yet.  And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what is<br>
happening in your life and how you are doing?  I know there are things<br>
going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to<br>
hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help.<br>
<br>
You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a strange<br>
way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are<br>
troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well<br>
through email.  Maybe we could grab a beer on Friday afternoon like last<br>
time at the Ale House (I'll be in town).  Let me know if you are available,<br>
respond by email when you can<br>
<br>
Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon,<br>
<br>

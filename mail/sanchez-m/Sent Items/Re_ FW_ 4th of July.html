Subject:	FW: 4th of July<br>
<br>
<br>
Todd is trying to reserve a large (sleeps 16 comfortably) cabin on Lake<br>
Travis around the 4th of July holiday.  The 4th is on a Wednesday this year<br>
so he'll probably reserve it through the proceeding or following weekend.<br>
I'm just trying to get a head count for now so anyone interested please let<br>
me know.<br>
<br>
We rented this place a couple years ago and had a great time.  It's located<br>
on the lake and has a private boat dock.  Todd will most likely have his<br>
boat for skiing and cruising the lake.  Other activities include Jet Ski<br>
rental, wind surfing rental, sun bathing, cooking out, and drinking.<br>

I called and it's available. I'm going to send them an email this afternoon<br>
and find out what the charges would be. I spoke to Bob's wife and she said<br>
that it goes for $600 a night, but that for an extended stay he will usually<br>
negotiate.<br>
<br>
I guess the next thing we would need to find out is how many people would be<br>
interested in staying at the house. Can you send Mark a note and let me know<br>
how many of the folks in H-town would be interested and for what days?<br>

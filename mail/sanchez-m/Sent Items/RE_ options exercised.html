Subject: options exercised<br>
<br>
I exercised my options today...for various reasons.<br>
<br>
First: stock moved around 1.3 yesterday and was up as high as 1.5<br>
today...now on its way back down.  I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i<br>
really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.<br>
<br>
Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were<br>
selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to<br>
enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron<br>
Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was<br>
released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India<br>
deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably<br>
going to move back down.<br>
<br>
Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee<br>
&quot;consumer&quot; confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see<br>
many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and<br>
the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly<br>
dissapating.<br>
<br>
Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price<br>
levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy<br>
money....I can always take the money market and get back in<br>
enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but<br>
the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few<br>
thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite<br>
uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.<br>
<br>
OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if<br>
that market continues to trend up.<br>
<br>
So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever<br>
written.<br>
Talk to you later hun<br>

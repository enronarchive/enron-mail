<div id=msg_body>
I exercised my options today...for various reasons.<br>
<br>
First: stock moved around 1.3 yesterday and was up as high as 1.5 today...now on its way back down.  I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.<br>
<br>
Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably going to move back down.<br>
<br>
Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee &quot;consumer&quot; confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly dissapating.<br>
<br>
Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy money....I can always take the money market and get back in enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.<br>
<br>
OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if that market continues to trend up.<br>
<br>
So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever written.<br>
Talk to you later hun<br>

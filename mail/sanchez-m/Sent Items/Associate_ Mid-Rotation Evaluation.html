Subject:	Associate/ Mid-Rotation Evaluation<br>
<br>
As you approach the mid point in your current rotation, please take this opportunity to fill out an evaluation form on your experience thus far.  This form will enable the Program's Career Development department to monitor many things such as quality of work, business unit culture and knowledge gained within your rotation. <br>
<br>
You will be pleased to know that your input will be used to staff new summer and full time employees.  We will also be able to identify any potential areas of improvement within the business units.  The Career Development department will be able to provide valuable information and compare rotations amongst business units.  This information will be provided to Commercial Staffing Leads and other business unit leaders.<br>
<br>
Remember, it is an opportunity to be heard.  Please complete the attached form and return to me via email or inter office mail.  If you would like this to be anonymous, please leave off your name but be sure to include your rotation information.  Thanks so much.<br>
<br>

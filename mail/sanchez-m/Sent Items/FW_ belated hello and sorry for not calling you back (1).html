Why don't we meet at the Ale House at 3:30 and share a beer or 2?  Can you<br>
do that??<br>

Hey there,<br>
No apologies necessary.  Actually yesterday I was knee deep in strawberry<br>
jam.  I spent a great part of the afternoon tied up with that at home.<br>
Made 12 jars and they go fast...I may do some more canning this weekend.<br>
Friday sounds great....just let me know what time.  Take care and talk to<br>
you soon,<br>
Mo.<br>

   I really wanted to spend some time talking with you this past weekend<br>
   but<br>
   with the bachelor party I was involved with, it was impossible to fit it<br>
   in.  And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels.  The<br>
   most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun<br>
   and<br>
   you always have intelligent things to say.  At a different level, I<br>
   think<br>
   you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value<br>
   you<br>
   what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm<br>
   very<br>
   good at yet.  And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what<br>
   is<br>
   happening in your life and how you are doing?  I know there are things<br>
   going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to<br>
   hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help.<br>
<br>
   You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a<br>
   strange<br>
   way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are<br>
   troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well<br>
   through email.  Maybe we could grab a beer on Friday afternoon like last<br>
   time at the Ale House (I'll be in town).  Let me know if you are<br>
   available,<br>
   respond by email when you can<br>
<br>
   Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon,<br>
<br>

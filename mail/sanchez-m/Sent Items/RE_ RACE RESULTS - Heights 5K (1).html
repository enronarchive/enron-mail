Ha.  I will definitely not be on that list.  Lets just say 32:30.  I was just focused on not puking when I crossed the finish so all I could make out was a big 32 on the clock. Thanks.<br>

An estimate works fine for the ERC.  As far as I know the site that usually posts results, www.runnertriathletenews.com only posted the top 3 spots in each age group.<br>

I have no idea what my finish time was.  It was somewhere in the 32:00 range....is there a website that I can look this up at? Thanks.<br>

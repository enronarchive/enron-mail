jeese, we don't have to leave this place just bc my trading profits are in a death spiral.  i can always stay here and bake cakes at the omni till you are ready to leave.  and then of course we have to consult the dogs and see what their schedule looks like.  ugh---this day is so bad.  i feel so helpless it just sucks.   i will give you a call when i head out to the hpy hr...did you get my message about AK?<br>
talk to you later.<br>

I got back form Germany on Friday and have been trying to catch up with work<br>
before our trip to Alaska.  We leave this Sunday the 10th.  Monique's<br>
brother is going to watch the dogs while we're gone so don't worry about it.<br>
It sounds like you've got your hands full.<br>
<br>
It's great you're buying a house.  We just can't seem to figure out what we<br>
want to do.  Monique is so stressed out with work right now I'm not sure how<br>
much longer we'll be in Houston.<br>
<br>
Did you get a good loan?  Did you get your truck yet?<br>

Hi Worm,<br>
<br>
How's it going?  I haven't heard from you in awhile!!<br>
What are the dates you are going to Alaska?<br>
Did Mom tell you I am buying a house?<br>
Well, I am.   And it is stressing me out!!!!!<br>
I have two offers on the table right now.<br>
Both of the houses are cute.  I just can't decide which one<br>
I like better.  You need to come visit soon.  Hopefully,<br>
I will be moved in when you bring Jake and Pearl up.<br>
How is Mo?  How is work?  How are the dogs?<br>
Let me know.<br>
Love,<br>
Jul<br>

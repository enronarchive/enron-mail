Things are fine.  I am getting thru a cold right now.....kind of on a plateau...not better not worse...just a bad cough.  I'd like to hear more about the stress test.  This weekend john will be going to the deer lease that he and a friend have paid for for the upcoming season.  They need to get it prepped I guess with feeders and what not....as well as check everything out.  I have apts on sat and sunday at hanks.  I've recruited a friend at work here to do the boxing workout with me on saturday.  I am planning on making strawberry jam either on sat afternoon/evening or sunday.  Otherwise I was just planning on reading, organizing some of my desk items, and tackling the spare bedroom once and for all.  I am really strapped for clothes space and the spare bedroom usually ends up a mess.  Maybe I can come by on sat early evening and we can fix dinner.  Maybe bring over a movie?  Just shoot me an email.  I will be in tomorrow but we usually head out of here on fridays early...around 3 or 4.<br>
Talk to you later.<br>

Hope things are going well.  David and Terry leave tomorrow morning early to<br>
Colorado.  If you have time, give Terry a call.  Mom is about the<br>
same...neither one of us get any sleep.  Have I ever told you how bad I have<br>
claustaphobia?  It really it this past Monday when I went for my Treadmill<br>
with Cardio Imaging.  This monster of a machine sat two inches from my face<br>
while I was on my back.  I was so stressed I could have just died.  Someday<br>
I will find out what in my past has contributed to this god awful fear.<br>
When I was on the Treadmill I felt like I was climbing Mt. Everest.  My<br>
tolerance was really tested.  I don't have any results from the test.  Got<br>
Army this weekend. Talk at you later.<br>

Bear Destroyed after Fatal Attack in Canada <br>
Compiled by Outside Online<br>
June 6, 2001 A black bear that attacked and killed a camper in Canada's Northwest Territories was shot yesterday by wildlife officials, according to press reports. <br>
<br>
Coroners determined that the bear shot yesterday was the same animal that mauled 18-year-old Kyle Harry on Saturday while he was camping with friends near Yellowknife. The bear had been shot by a RCMP officer at the scene of the attack on Saturday and a necropsy uncovered bullet fragments in the bear's chest that matched the type of bullet used by the officer, a wildlife official told the London Free Press. <br>
<br>
Harry and five other teens had camped overnight on Friday before four members of the group left early on Saturday morning, the London Free Press reports. Harry and a 14-year-old girl stayed behind and saw the bear come into their campground around noon. They pulled their food inside of their tent then later made a break for a ridge after the bear approached the tent. The girl was able to escape and get to the road where she was taken to the hospital by a passing car. Harry, caught by the bear as he ascended the ridge, was found dead by officials. A report yesterday by The Outdoor Network says the bear was feeding on Harry when officials arrived. <br>
<br>
On Sunday police and wildlife officials launched an intensive search for the animal, employing a helicopter and infrared scanner. Another bear shot on Monday was determined not be the one responsible for the attack. <br>
<br>
On July 2 of last year, 24-year-old Canadian biathlete Mary-Beth Miller was killed by a black bear while on a training run at the Myriam Bedard Biathlon Centre near Quebec City. <br>

Alright!<br>
<br>
Lets start the invites...<br>
I'll invite suebob and anyone she wants to bring with...she's got a friend from outta town.<br>
May invite Keith and Tracy...he wants to check out our house/neighborhood.<br>
May even invite Dennis from cooking school and his wife since they live close by...hmmmm<br>
this could get a bit large..which is not to bad....we could set up horseshoes in the front yard...that would be fun.<br>
We'll talk more tonight and construct an email......Based on our headcount we can figure out what the best food is to fix and then possible divy up some of the bringins.<br>

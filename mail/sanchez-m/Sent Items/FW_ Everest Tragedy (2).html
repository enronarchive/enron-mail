This email just came in today.  One of our brokers from New York has a brother in-law who just summited Everest yesterday at 10eastern.  There is a west gas trader that works in new york that is writing the account below.  Apparently there was a drastic change in the elements and several are already dead and there is a major rescue underway.  I haven't even found anything on this yet on the internet, though i expect there will be news shortly.  I thought you all would be moved by this account.<br>

&gt; &gt; Unfortunately i am too late to halt my last email. Perspective comes<br>
&gt; &gt; quickly<br>
&gt; &gt; at 8000 meters and today, thinking back on the ascent and all the rock<br>
&gt; &gt; climbing moves on that ridge that might have left me dead given my<br>
&gt; &gt; perpetually clumsy condition (wrsened by AMS), I am happy to be alive.<br>
&gt;The<br>
&gt; &gt; weather is beautiful but the mountain has bitten back and many are dead<br>
&gt; &gt; and<br>
&gt; &gt; dying, including friends of mine from my own team who summitted too late<br>
&gt; &gt; for<br>
&gt; &gt; the north side. By the time i am allowed to send this, the media will<br>
&gt;have<br>
&gt; &gt; already begun reporting on this tragedy. I was slowed by my vomiting and<br>
&gt; &gt; had<br>
&gt; &gt; i continued, i likely would have been trudging up with this group.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In my last email there is black humor concerning one of my friends:<br>
&gt; &gt; ensuring<br>
&gt; &gt; his safety so suz and i could take a vacation. He is stuck on the ridge<br>
&gt; &gt; now,<br>
&gt; &gt; dying, and will likely be dead by morning. One of our strongest guides<br>
&gt;is<br>
&gt; &gt; with him and he, too, will probably die. This guy is super strong but<br>
&gt;the<br>
&gt; &gt; altitude has snatched him. We're in shock here and can do nothing but<br>
&gt; &gt; stare<br>
&gt; &gt; into telescopes and pray that they continue the bleak fight. I have been<br>
&gt; &gt; assigned NOK duty and have made two very tough phone calls to young<br>
&gt;wives.<br>
&gt; &gt; A<br>
&gt; &gt; member of the Aussie expedition died suddenly at Camp 2 this morning, 3<br>
&gt; &gt; Russians are stuck with our men on the ridge, and a spaniard is flirting<br>
&gt; &gt; with death right now after a bout with cerebral edema, despite Chris<br>
&gt; &gt; Warner's valiant effort to get him down from the ridge last night. When<br>
&gt;i<br>
&gt; &gt; think of this mountain now, i think only of death.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Russ is quite experienced in hig-altitude rescues but this is the first<br>
&gt; &gt; time<br>
&gt; &gt; he has unleashed the team for our own. It is a totaly professional<br>
&gt; &gt; logistical operation (locating and moving oxygen and regulataors back up<br>
&gt; &gt; into the jet stream), relying heavily on the sherps who are just<br>
&gt; &gt; incredibly<br>
&gt; &gt; strong. Many stories of heroism over last 24 hours and many to come. The<br>
&gt; &gt; guide and the client spent the night on the ridge (8650 meters),<br>
&gt; &gt; incoherent<br>
&gt; &gt; and immobile, freezing, but they were saved when Asmus turned around<br>
&gt;from<br>
&gt; &gt; a<br>
&gt; &gt; desperate stumble home, climbed the second step (brutal) for the second<br>
&gt; &gt; time<br>
&gt; &gt; in 10 hours, and delivered oxygen to the desperate pair just before<br>
&gt;dark.<br>
&gt; &gt; Asmus tried to roust them and then had to dash for lower altitudes,<br>
&gt; &gt; reaching<br>
&gt; &gt; top camp (8300 meters...still incredibly dangerous) at 11:30 pm. It was<br>
&gt;a<br>
&gt; &gt; relatively warm night (just below)and both client and guide were seen<br>
&gt; &gt; moving<br>
&gt; &gt; space blankets this morning through the telescope. Alive. But they could<br>
&gt; &gt; not<br>
&gt; &gt; stand. One could not see. No comms. Bivouacs above 8000 meters are epics<br>
&gt; &gt; and<br>
&gt; &gt; you are sure to read about this.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Coordinating therescue from the Col, Russ then rousted all available<br>
&gt; &gt; bodies<br>
&gt; &gt; and they started up the ridge for the second time in as many days, Purba<br>
&gt; &gt; and<br>
&gt; &gt; Lopsang leading the way back into the death zone, humping oxygen. The<br>
&gt; &gt; American expedition came upont the bodies this morning and have given up<br>
&gt; &gt; their summit attempt (remember, they failed last week and also failed in<br>
&gt; &gt; '99<br>
&gt; &gt; so this is a huge sacrifice) to make the rescue. It looked bleak this<br>
&gt; &gt; morning but after some injections our teammates began to move, carried<br>
&gt;by<br>
&gt; &gt; the strong Americans. As i type, they have been moving at a snail's pace<br>
&gt; &gt; and<br>
&gt; &gt; the Americans will soon have to leave them to save themselves.We hope<br>
&gt;our<br>
&gt; &gt; sherps are there by then and can take over for what is turning out to be<br>
&gt; &gt; an<br>
&gt; &gt; absolutely epic and incredibly dangerous rescue. Remember, that ridge is<br>
&gt; &gt; 14<br>
&gt; &gt; inches across for stretches, dropping 10,000 feet on either side. When i<br>
&gt; &gt; gazed down 2 nights ago, it was truly like staring out of the window of<br>
&gt;a<br>
&gt; &gt; plane, so steep was the drop. The sherps are going to have to be<br>
&gt;supermen.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; From the ridge and high camp, chris and asmus (they've been wasting<br>
&gt;there<br>
&gt; &gt; for over 36 hours now) have been gathering oxygen for the 2000 meter<br>
&gt; &gt; descent<br>
&gt; &gt; to ABC. They are sucking some themselves to ensure we don't have a<br>
&gt; &gt; double-rescue. I'm feeling better and i may be going up to the col to<br>
&gt;help<br>
&gt; &gt; with the rescue, assuming we get these guys off the ridge alive. Too<br>
&gt;high<br>
&gt; &gt; for a helo on this side so we'll have to platoon them down asap. Other<br>
&gt; &gt; members who summitted earlier are still up too high, too slow descending<br>
&gt; &gt; from 'safe' camps, and i may help them down as well. So i will not be<br>
&gt;back<br>
&gt; &gt; by mem day--we have to get these people down.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The drama unfolded yesterday as i stared through a spotting scope,<br>
&gt;sulking<br>
&gt; &gt; and making occasional trips to the waste moraine. The client was slower<br>
&gt; &gt; and<br>
&gt; &gt; slower and then he just stopped on the summit snow field. I thought: uh<br>
&gt; &gt; oh.<br>
&gt; &gt; Russ had warned them hours before to turn but summit fever had taken<br>
&gt;hold<br>
&gt; &gt; and the guide was pursuaded by the client. Soon russ was on the radio<br>
&gt; &gt; screaming at the guide to drag the client down, but the hour grew late<br>
&gt;and<br>
&gt; &gt; suddenly a successful summit evolved into a death trap, both men<br>
&gt;immobile<br>
&gt; &gt; and nearly incoherent, the guide kicking and draggin the client, to no<br>
&gt; &gt; avail. Asmus was with them and performed valiantly, as i mentioned, but<br>
&gt;no<br>
&gt; &gt; one was in a position to help. At that height, every second counts and<br>
&gt;the<br>
&gt; &gt; other teams rushed past on their way to safety. When you rush into a<br>
&gt; &gt; burning<br>
&gt; &gt; building you can't linger, especially if your physical performance is<br>
&gt; &gt; literally cut in half.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I am praying for these two--and the russians--and  it's hard to think f<br>
&gt; &gt; anything else as they progress home, mumbling, step by step. I have<br>
&gt; &gt; messages<br>
&gt; &gt; from their wives but they are unable to [process spoken language at this<br>
&gt; &gt; point. Even if they get down, i wonder what the results will be. It's<br>
&gt; &gt; really<br>
&gt; &gt; sad. I am sure they are also severely dehydrated--i'll explain the<br>
&gt;process<br>
&gt; &gt; when i get home but siffice to say you literally can't boil water fast<br>
&gt; &gt; enough to keepup with needs of body at altitude. My heartbeat at top<br>
&gt;camp<br>
&gt; &gt; was 180 when i was 'resting' in my sleeping bag before the attempt. My<br>
&gt; &gt; tongue split down the middle even though i was trying to keep the fluids<br>
&gt; &gt; coming at a rate of a liter an hour, doing nothing.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I feel lucky today. Very lucky. When i think of my own descent, alone,<br>
&gt; &gt; throwing up along the way yesterday, i realize just how razor-thin this<br>
&gt; &gt; whole thing is. There were times on the ridge where i was hanging by my<br>
&gt; &gt; jumar on a supposedly new rope, ony to reach the anchor point to find a<br>
&gt; &gt; ten-year-old knot, totally fried by the uv rays. Other times i stepped<br>
&gt;in<br>
&gt; &gt; snow footprints and slipped, sliding down on my stomach until the rope<br>
&gt; &gt; jerked taut. Too many ways to die here.The aussie who gave me his water<br>
&gt;in<br>
&gt; &gt; the bowl may have prevented another casualty. Who's to say? Problem here<br>
&gt; &gt; is<br>
&gt; &gt; that, unlike the events we're used to when we sprint to the finish line<br>
&gt; &gt; (we<br>
&gt; &gt; used to say in crew that the perfect race was when you passsed out at<br>
&gt;the<br>
&gt; &gt; finish), you have to reserve a certain amount to get the hell down the<br>
&gt; &gt; mountain. And it's so hard to do that. Is a quarter tank enough? Half?<br>
&gt;Or<br>
&gt; &gt; do<br>
&gt; &gt; you need even more because, in truth, you are dying from the moment you<br>
&gt; &gt; leave camp 3 (not even top camp).<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I will pass this info only when the word is out--sorry--but will keep<br>
&gt;you<br>
&gt; &gt; updated from there once i talk ro russ. It's hard watching friends die<br>
&gt;but<br>
&gt; &gt; we're helpless down here.<br>

I know your ad said that you wouldn't reply to anything without a picture but I'm not really computer literate yet and I thought your posting was interesting.  Energy law is a hobby for me right now since I'm an electricity trader for Enron.  Anyway, I'm not really looking for anything more than to meet some new people.  Hanging around traders all the time gets a little out of control and leads to meeting the wrong girls.  If you want to email let me know.<br>

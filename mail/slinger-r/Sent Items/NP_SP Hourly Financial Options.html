The following are the basics on what I was proposing on hourly call/put options:<br>
<br>
1.  Structure:<br>
	a. Delivery Point: NP15 or SP15<br>
	b. Strike Price: determined at time of purchase or sale<br>
	c. Quantity:  one option equals 25 megawatt hours<br>
	c. Premium:  one time cash outlay for right of option quote as dollars per megawatt hour<br>
	d. Settlement Index:  Expost, determined under the expost tab on the cal iso web site as the 10 minute average zonal price for the hour in which the option is to be settled.<br>
	e. Exercise deadline:  Must be exercised 2 hours and 10 minutes prior to the begininng of physical power flow for the hour in which option will be settled financially.<br>
	f.  Duration of option:  Expires at 20:50 of the day in which the option was purchased/sold.<br>
<br>
	*In most cases I can quote a premium in which I will be willing to settle the option financially OR physically.<br>
	** Of course execution of a transaction is subject to the counterparty having the appropriate credit approval for the agreed upon financial and or physical deals.<br>

Subject:	you don't need access to stack manager?<br>
Importance:	High<br>
<br>
I assume that since you didn't respond to my first two emails, none of you require access to stack manager.  If this is incorrect, please respond to my previous emails.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. <br>
<br>
We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:<br>
<br>
1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). <br>
or<br>
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your &quot;native&quot; desktop (stand alone computer).<br>
<br>
Please reply to this message with either a corresponding &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;2&quot; in the subject field.<br>
<br>
If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>

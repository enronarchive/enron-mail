Hey, good to hear from you.  All is going well here.  I'm still with Enron for a few days.  Our division just got bought out by the Union Bank of Switzerland, or better known as UBS.  I guess things didn't work out so well for most with the company, but what are you gonna do.  Right now it's 6am and I am the only one here.  About 75% of our portland office got laid off.  I'm in early to read my new contract with UBS, I think I'm going to sign it which means I'll be here for another year at least.  I should end up getting a new UBS email address soon, also my hotmail account is a good address, rmsling@hotmail.com	So when are you up in Portland?  It was two years ago january since I've seen you!  Hope everthing is going well.<br>

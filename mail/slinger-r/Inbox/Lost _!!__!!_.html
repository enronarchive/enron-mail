So, I do not know if this will get to you . But if it does- I pulled out of <br>
the parkingg lot the other night and drove up Beaverton Hillsdale, went left <br>
onto the street to your house,and I donot have the faintest idea of how to <br>
get to your house!! Shocking since I am always half crocked! Not meant to be <br>
funny. Anyway, I should have callled-Do not have your # in my new <br>
phon-BLAH,BLAH. I was looking forward to not being hammed around you for <br>
once. So, if you get this(I got the adress off your business card I just <br>
found in my wallet) WB or call 901-0376. I am extremly embarresed and I am <br>
sure when you think of me it is not good. But there could be a slim chance <br>
that you still have one ounce of respect for me. So, if you do , I will talk <br>
to you soon. I am sorry !!!!! Noelle<br>
<br>

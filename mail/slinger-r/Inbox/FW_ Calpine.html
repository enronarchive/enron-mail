 &gt;   Calpine's Credibility Crumbles<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;By Peter Eavis<br>
 &gt;Senior Columnist<br>
 &gt;12/11/2001 06:49 PM EST<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis) talks and the<br>
 &gt;market walks.<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;The fast-growing power producer received a ton of flak Monday for taking<br>
 &gt;no questions on a conference call designed at rebutting a critical article<br>
 &gt;by The New York Times. Calpine held another call Tuesday -- with the<br>
 &gt;stated aim of discussing talks to renegotiate power sale contracts with<br>
 &gt;the state of California -- and spent more than three hours responding to a<br>
 &gt;range of issues raised by concerned holders and snarky critics.<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;But soon after this marathon gabfest got under way, Calpine stock, already<br>
 &gt;down for the day, plummeted after a series of remarks by executives that<br>
 &gt;the market didn't like. It ended the day down 13% at $15.50, a 52-week low.<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;If Detox had to make a list of why the market biffed Calpine during the<br>
 &gt;call, these would be the reasons:<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;1. Dilution. Calpine executives said they would be willing to issue stock<br>
 &gt;at a low price if cash were needed, and if debt couldn't be issued because<br>
 &gt;it would push the leverage ratio above acceptable levels. (Leverage is<br>
 &gt;here defined as debt to total capital, while capital is debt plus equity<br>
 &gt;and equitylike securities.) The executives didn't say an equity issue was<br>
 &gt;imminent or probable. However, the fact that an offering could be done at<br>
 &gt;a low stock price would make it dilutive for existing shareholders. A big<br>
 &gt;negative. To raise $1 billion at Tuesday's stock price, Calpine would have<br>
 &gt;to issue about 65 million shares, equivalent to 20% of its shares<br>
 &gt;outstanding at the end of the third quarter. Notably, Calpine executives<br>
 &gt;said that they probably wouldn't use an equity issue to pay back a $1<br>
 &gt;billion convertible bond that may need refinancing in April.<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;2. Natural gas assets. Calpine said it could, if it had to, raise $1<br>
 &gt;billion from &quot;monetizing&quot; its natural gas reserves. That would provide the<br>
 &gt;company with cash, but it would put an up-to-date price on the assets that<br>
 &gt;could be well below what Calpine recently paid for them. That might force<br>
 &gt;the company to do a big writedown to equity, which would, in turn, damage<br>
 &gt;leverage ratios. On the call, Calpine executives played down the notion<br>
 &gt;that they may have to do a writedown, saying future gas prices suggest one<br>
 &gt;isn't necessary.<br>

 &gt;<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;3. Earnings outlook. Not only did the company say it may have to revise<br>
 &gt;2002 earnings guidance, but it also showed uncertainty about<br>
 &gt;fourth-quarter 2001 earnings. This looks bad for three reasons. First, it<br>
 &gt;suggests that Calpine has more of its business unhedged than investors<br>
 &gt;have believed, leaving the company vulnerable to the slump in power<br>
 &gt;prices. Second, it will add weight to the argument that a glut of power<br>
 &gt;generation capacity is building. Third, and critically for investors<br>
 &gt;looking for a bottom in Calpine stock, a large cut in the 2002 earnings<br>
 &gt;outlook could make the stock look a lot pricier than it is at multiples<br>
 &gt;based on current Street estimates. Analysts currently expect Calpine to<br>
 &gt;make $2.52 a share in 2002, putting the stock on a bargain-basement<br>
 &gt;price-earnings ratio of 6 to 1. But if earnings were to be half that, the<br>
 &gt;P/E would obviously double to 12, which would actually be quite expensive<br>
 &gt;for a company that faces liquidity constraints that could force it to<br>
 &gt;jettison its growth strategy. If Calpine continues to struggle to clear<br>
 &gt;its name, a floor for its stock price may be book value, currently $9 a <br>
share.<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;4. Renegotiating California contracts. Although this was the ostensible<br>
 &gt;subject of the call, too little was said on this issue. The company gave<br>
 &gt;no indication of how much business might be at stake and was reluctant to<br>
 &gt;surmise on how much of a hit it might take from recasting the forward gas<br>
 &gt;purchases made to fuel the power production.<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;5. Accounting issues remain. Calpine revealed on the call that it uses it<br>
 &gt;own in-house method to calculate its leverage. This unorthodox method,<br>
 &gt;which adds $700 million paid for a Canadian gas company to equity, makes<br>
 &gt;the company's leverage ratio look lower than it actually is. At one point<br>
 &gt;on the call, a Calpine executive couldn't detail what was added to net<br>
 &gt;income to get to the company's earnings before interest, taxes,<br>
 &gt;depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) number. This is pertinent because<br>
 &gt;SEC Insight, a research firm that reviews internal Securities and Exchange<br>
 &gt;Commission documents, said in a report Tuesday that the SEC had talked<br>
 &gt;with Calpine about the way it presents its EBITDA number in its SEC-filed<br>
 &gt;financials.<br>
 &gt;<br>
 &gt;6. Bank loans and liquidity. Much time was spent addressing whether<br>
 &gt;Calpine can increase the size of a corporate revolving loan to $1.5<br>
 &gt;billion from $400 million. The company said it thought it could do this in<br>
 &gt;early January. But banks that have gotten burned by lending to Enron<br>
 &gt;(ENE:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis) may now be scaling<br>
 &gt;back their energy exposure. What's more, Calpine is trying to raise the<br>
 &gt;size of a corporate loan, implying that the funds aren't needed primarily<br>
 &gt;for construction purposes. Could the need for new cash have arisen within<br>
 &gt;the company's trading operations? Calpine said Tuesday that its<br>
 &gt;counterparties weren't asking for more collateral. But if the trading desk<br>
 &gt;is consuming more, then it's even more unlikely that the banks will<br>
 &gt;increase their credit line, considering the Enron meltdown.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;/x-flowed&gt;<br>

Susan,<br>
Thanksgiving was great!  Hope yours was a well?<br>

Thanks for letting us know about Orientation.  Would you be interested in<br>
taking a tour of the new Cancer Center at another time?  I was planning on<br>
setting up an alternative tour time if anyone is interested.  Let me know.<br>

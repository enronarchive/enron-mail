As you are probably aware, your department has been selected to participate <br>
in Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In <br>
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information <br>
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data <br>
collection, we have automated the process and your system has just been <br>
inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working with <br>
your department co-ordinator, Sheri Cromwell, to consolidate this information <br>
to ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.<br>
<br>
The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any <br>
questions, please call Lee Steele at 713-345-8259.<br>

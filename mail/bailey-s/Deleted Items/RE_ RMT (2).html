Susan,<br>
<br>
I don't remember if I sent this to you already - so<br>
here's the spreadsheet....there are almost 9,000 RMT deals.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Do you need these confirms too?  Please say no.  :)<br>

My request was for the financial deals.  But if you have access to the physical RMT/Intercompany -- I would like those too.<br>

Ok.<br>
<br>
And regarding the Risk Management deals......I forget what we decided....what &quot;begin&quot; date do you want on the query......deals from 12/1/01 forward or was in sometime in November?  <br>

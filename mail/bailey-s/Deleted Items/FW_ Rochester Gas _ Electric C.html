Angelo: In this morning's meeting I said I would forward the information I have on the RG&amp;E payment.  Please see below.  It is not clear to me whether they are paid in full.  Can you determine?  <br>
<br>
Susan: DDL update to reflect that they paid and Angelo is analyzing to determine whether they are paid in full.<br>

I'm afraid I will need it.  I can come by right now to pick it up.  Is that okay?<br>

I see that we received $801,303.20 from RG&amp;E on 3/15/02.  The total of the invoices listed below is $786,815.26.  Is the incremental amount associated w/ another invoice or does it relate to interest on overdue payment?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

Thanks.  It's always nice to put a name with a face.  I have put some feelers out regarding this check but have not heard anything yet.  I will let you know if I do.<br>

Enjoyed meeting you today.<br>
<br>
The invoices I am expecting RG&amp;E to pay are listed below.<br>
<br>
Jan02 #0201414 for $258,403.20<br>
Nov01 #01121913 for $252,450.03<br>
Dec01 #01122168 for $275,962.03<br>
<br>
As we discussed, they said they would send a check and my concern is it went into a lockbox or possibly the wrong account.  They may have paid and it could be difficult for us to see the payment.  Let me know if you uncover anything.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

Leonard,<br>
<br>
WELCOME BACK !!!!!   Hope you and Dorothy had a pleasant trip to Germany???   Hope all is well with Kasie??? I would love to hear all about it.<br>
<br>
While you were gone, Maria Pirro contacted me -- she is with West Penn Appraisers, Inc. (&quot;WPA&quot;).  She faxed their fee schedule relating to the various Sciullo Properties and signed off on my approval as to costs, so WPA is beginning their work.<br>
<br>
FYI:	I have sent to WPA the monies for the Burger King appraisal as well as the Willow Farms lots.  However, there are some properties for which Four Star or Dan &amp; I are not a party to.   Therefore, the payment of those appraisals must be handled probably by you or my Dad.<br>
<br>
I will fax the WPA fee Schedule, so you know what properties constitute WPA's idea of the &quot;Sciullo Properties&quot;.<br>
<br>
Once again, welcome back.<br>
<br>
Susan <br>

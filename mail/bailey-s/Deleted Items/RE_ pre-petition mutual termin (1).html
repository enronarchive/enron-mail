Alan,<br>
<br>
I have yet to compile these agreements into a binder, as they were not organized upon my receipt.<br>
<br>
I will provide copies of the agreements to you shortly.<br>
<br>
I have left Tom Moran a voice-mail and hope to hear from him today -- so we can confirm that we have all pre-petition mutual terminations.<br>
<br>

As you requested, I am attaching my list of pre-petition mutual terminations (as well as 3 post-petition mutual terminations).  This list is located in excel in my misc. directory.  As per your direction, I will also deliver my binder of mutual terminations to Susan Bailey.<br>

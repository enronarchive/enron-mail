Lets go with Sat. Lunch.  How about 1:00pm, or would early be better???<br>
<br>
Yes, I remembered that Lilly was coming for visit in March -- thanks for letting know the exact date.<br>
<br>
We must get together just the girls, as well as trying to see if Basil could join us for dinner, along with David &amp; Steve.<br>

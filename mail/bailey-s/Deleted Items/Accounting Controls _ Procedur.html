From:  Ray Bowen, Office of the Chief Executive <br>
<br>
One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company.  Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective.<br>
<br>
A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.<br>
<br>
Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson.  Joining Rick will be Donna Lowry who will manage compliance and records retention controls.  <br>
<br>
To be effective, everyone in the organization must be an active participant in the control process.  In this regard, your cooperation with Rick and his team is appreciated. <br>

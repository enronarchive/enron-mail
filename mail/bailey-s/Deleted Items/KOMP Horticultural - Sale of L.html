<br>
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.<br>
<br>
The following guidelines must be followed:<br>
·	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.<br>
·	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. <br>
·	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  <br>
·	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. <br>
·	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    <br>

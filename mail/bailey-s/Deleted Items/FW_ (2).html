Re: Stephen &amp; Susan Bailey 2001 Tax Return<br>
<br>
Dear Clint,<br>
I am sending over to you today our tax organizer and supporting <br>
documentation. I am including a copy of this email in the front of the <br>
packet. Sorry for the delay but I had some difficulty rounding up <br>
documentation on a real estate transaction that needs to be addressed. In <br>
any event, we are still going to need an extension to file because Susan is <br>
awaiting tax information from Lincoln National Life Insurance as indicated <br>
on the enclosed schedule. I also need to discuss with you some issues <br>
regarding the sale of some family trust real estate (Washington County <br>
property) which probably needs to be characterized as capital gain to me. <br>
In particular, I had to purchase an adjoining tract a couple of years ago <br>
(The Emmerich Tract) to facilitate the sale of my interest in the entire <br>
acreage. The closing papers and related correspondence concerning both the <br>
Emmerich Tract purchase and sale of the Washington County property are <br>
enclosed. I have assumed that the acquisition costs of the Emmerich tract <br>
in 1998 (which was subsequently included in the sale of my interest in the <br>
Washington County property in 2001) is subtracted from my portion of the <br>
net proceeds from the 2001 sale for capital gains purposes. In any event, <br>
assuming the sale is capital gain, we took stock losses that should offset <br>
a substantial part of it. By my rough calculation, the net gain on the sale <br>
of the real estate (after deducting the acquisition cost of the Emmerich <br>
tract) is approximately $26,000 and we had stock sale losses of <br>
approximately $19,000. My salary increased somewhat and Susan's stayed <br>
about he same during 2001; but we also had a substantially larger share of <br>
interest/ taxes on our home which was purchased in mid-2000. So, I'm not <br>
sure where we'll come out as compared to last year's taxes but I'd feel <br>
comfortable paying what we did last year as an estimate unless you think <br>
otherwise. Please let me know and, once again, sorry for the delay in <br>
forwarding this to you. Thanks,<br>
<br>
Steve Bailey<br>
<br>
P.S. On personal note, I hope you are doing well after such an <br>
extraordinary past year. Susan is still at Enron and its been interesting. <br>
I've been glad to see 2001 go by the wayside. Talk soon. SRB<br>
<br>

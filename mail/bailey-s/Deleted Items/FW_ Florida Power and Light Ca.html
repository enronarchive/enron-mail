How are we handling this type of issue? Are we sending them a letter indicating that they still have to pay for gas we have already delivered? Are we reading the contracts on a one-off basis to determine our rights? This is probably our largest gas deal with the biggest receivable $$ in the door - and also big in the money MTM from our perspective. <br>

I spoke with Scott Borgmeyer of Florida Power and Light and FPL Energy Power Mktg.<br>
concerning their payments that are due on December 17th and December 26th.<br>
 According to Scott, they will not be making payments to us on these days due to the termination <br>
of their contract effective December 12th.  They will not be paying at this time due to unwinding <br>
arrangements of terminated contracts.  Payment amounts due are as follows:<br>
<br>
December 17th	$21,064,010.57  FP&amp;L<br>
<br>
December 26th  $ 6,965,765.30   FP&amp;L<br>
<br>
December 26th  $     22,077.24   FPL Energy Power Marketing<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; How you doing? Have you spoken to Clay since he and I went to ya'lls<br>
&gt; ranch?<br>
&gt; We had a truly wild time. Early Saturday morning we ran into a little<br>
&gt; family<br>
&gt; of javelinas and had a stare down from about 30 feet with a young male<br>
&gt; after<br>
&gt; his sows and piglets crossed directly in front of us w/out notice. We <br>
were<br>
&gt; all cammo'ed up and I imagine we may have looked like that &quot;Predator&quot;<br>
&gt; creature to him. As he was crossing the path he must have caught our <br>
scent<br>
&gt; as he first turned his head in our direction and then fully squared off<br>
&gt; directly in front of me in the middle of the small game trail we were on.<br>
&gt; He<br>
&gt; was looking right at me but I could tell he couldn't really SEE me.<br>
&gt; Neither<br>
&gt; Clay nor I moved even a fraction. Clay was close behind me and to my <br>
right<br>
&gt; looking over my shoulder so we may have looked like a two headed <br>
predator,<br>
&gt; but more importantly Clay was blocking my escape path. There was a very<br>
&gt; large and thick prickly pear cactus outgrowth to my left. At first it was<br>
&gt; just an incredibly cool nature experience. I expected him to catch our<br>
&gt; scent<br>
&gt; at any moment and hightail it. But he didn't. After staring at us for<br>
&gt; maybe<br>
&gt; a full 2 mins, his wet black snout occasionally flaring &amp; giving me an<br>
&gt; exceptional view of the blotched pink insides of his nostrils, he took a<br>
&gt; very pronounced step toward us. Right front leg bent in mid air, he then<br>
&gt; very deliberately stomped it down hard on the ground, making a small<br>
&gt; thumping noise. He then followed this with the left front leg. Stomp.<br>
&gt; Between each step he'd inhale with a deep audible snort, trying to figure<br>
&gt; us<br>
&gt; out. Step (stomp) pause snort. Step (stomp) pause snort. Step (stomp)<br>
&gt; pause<br>
&gt; snort. Step (stomp) pause snort.<br>
&gt; Now, not knowing much about Javelinas and figuring this little dude <br>
didn't<br>
&gt; weigh more than 40 lbs, I wasn't exactly scared, but I was definitely on<br>
&gt; an<br>
&gt; adrenaline high, my heart racing. I was slightly concerned that if, on <br>
the<br>
&gt; off chance that he did charge, which I honestly didn't think he'd would, <br>
I<br>
&gt; was going to be in some trouble. I doubted I could have gotten a shot <br>
off,<br>
&gt; and Clay, as I said, was blocking my escape path. I lost my nerve after<br>
&gt; what<br>
&gt; seemed like 3-5 mins of this, he was now within 10 feet of me. I turned <br>
my<br>
&gt; head very slowly to the side, never taking my eyes off the little fire<br>
&gt; plug<br>
&gt; to ask Clay how close should we let him get. The slight motion of my head<br>
&gt; turning was all he needed. He apparently now had a lock on his target<br>
&gt; (me!)<br>
&gt; and he charged. It all happened so damn fast but there was that surreal<br>
&gt; quality of slow-motion over the next 15 seconds. He opened his mouth<br>
&gt; really<br>
&gt; wide, unusually, freakishly wide and I could see two large incisor teeth<br>
&gt; on<br>
&gt; his bottom jaw jutting up 2 or 3 inches. These had NOT been evident to me<br>
&gt; prior to this! Simultaneously I sensed Clay turning to run. FAST. For<br>
&gt; whatever reason running was not even an option I considered. I swung my<br>
&gt; shotgun seven to ten inches to my center, instantaneously deciding this<br>
&gt; was<br>
&gt; going to have to be a hip shot, I somehow calmly thumbed the safety off,<br>
&gt; aimed and fired at this oncoming mass of mouth and course black hair, now<br>
&gt; probably no more than three feet directly in front of me. I was loaded<br>
&gt; with<br>
&gt; two 20 gauge slugs. The single shot I fired blew a fairly large hole<br>
&gt; through<br>
&gt; the top of his head but his forward momentum carried him through my legs<br>
&gt; at<br>
&gt; shin level, knocking me hard, forward and over the javelina, splaying me<br>
&gt; stomach first flat on the ground, still clutching my shotgun. The fall<br>
&gt; knocked the wind out of me but I quickly got up on one knee, not knowing<br>
&gt; how<br>
&gt; true my aim had been and swung my gun back on the downed pig. No movement<br>
&gt; whatsoever. It was eerily quiet for just a few seconds and I felt a <br>
slight<br>
&gt; and strange breeze. I then heard some crashing noise in the brush near by<br>
&gt; and one of the sows exploded through the thicket to my left coming right<br>
&gt; for<br>
&gt; me. Holy shit! I couldn't believe it. Still kneeling, and still with no<br>
&gt; breath, I swung my shouldered shotgun and shot her in the chest at<br>
&gt; probably<br>
&gt; fifteen feet. Because I was on my knees the blast hit her squarely and<br>
&gt; lifted her up and to the left of the trail. But to my horror immediately<br>
&gt; behind her and coming FAST was a LARGE male we had not previously seen. <br>
He<br>
&gt; looked twice the size of the first javelina. He was all gray and grizzled<br>
&gt; and he too had his mouth fully opened, his tusks literally gleaming.<br>
&gt; However, I was seeing 'his' charge, head on, at eye level, out of ammo <br>
and<br>
&gt; quite frankly nothing was going through my mind other than &quot;OH SHIT!!! OH<br>
&gt; SHIT!!!! OH SHIT!!!!&quot;. I then heard Clay yell/holler/demand VERY loudly<br>
&gt; &quot;DON'T MOVE!!!&quot; ... and then BAMMMMM! I didn't move. My eyes were glued <br>
to<br>
&gt; the boar. Clay's shot nailed the old male in the left shoulder powering<br>
&gt; him<br>
&gt; ten feet to my left from the spot of impact as if he'd been kicked by a<br>
&gt; giant invisible boot, before he came to a sudden stop against a mesquite<br>
&gt; tree. Three shots in maybe 10 seconds, three dead javelinas,  blood and<br>
&gt; stink everywhere. Clay came running over to me yelling something like,<br>
&gt; &quot;Are<br>
&gt; you OK? Are you OK?&quot; and helped me up the rest of the way. I was shaking<br>
&gt; like a leaf and trying to get my breath back and he started laughing <br>
hard,<br>
&gt; I<br>
&gt; mean really hard, after seeing I was OK. Somehow I had javalena blood on<br>
&gt; the<br>
&gt; left palm of my hand. After dusting off I notice the inside of my left<br>
&gt; pant<br>
&gt; leg was ripped and my left boot was cleanly sheered from the inside of my<br>
&gt; right ankle through the top of the boot where the calf starts, but my <br>
skin<br>
&gt; was not even nicked. Mannnn.... I'll never think of those damn javelina<br>
&gt; the<br>
&gt; same way again, and I don't even want to think what may have happened if<br>
&gt; Clay hadn't shot the big male.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Can you believe it?!<br>
&gt; Later,<br>

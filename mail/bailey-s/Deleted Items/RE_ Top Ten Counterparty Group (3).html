I think its great that you asked Melissa -- it would be fine if your lists are intergrated, that would be great.<br>

I too noted that BP Capital Energy Fund L.P. had terminated by mutual termination; however, include them on your list for the time being.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
FYI:  thanks for including Melissa -- I had sent her a separate email as we had spoken over the phone concerning the project request.<br>

BP Capital Energy Fund L.P. was marked as a &quot;Y&quot; for termination on the latest Letter Log and Master Termination Log we received from Stephanie Panus....so do we include them in the list or not?  I was in the process of sending their list of deals over to Risk to be swung into the Bankruptcy books.  <br>
<br>
Melissa - can you run this query for Power and send me a spreadsheet?  I'll merge it into whatever we find for Gas, Crude, Paper, Weather, etc...  for each counterparty?<br>
<br>
Bob - can you do physical gas?  <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Diane<br>

Susan: My bad!  Maybe the payment combines two Williams entities and that would explain why they amount exceeds our invoice amount.<br>
<br>
Shielah: Angelo gave me your name as a contact that could help with regard to cash inflows.  Please provide detail about the cash inflow from Williams on 3/5/02.  Specifically, which Williams company(s) provided the payment?  Thanks<br>

I have entered into the Demand Log the cash payment information for the counterparties listed below.<br>
<br>
I have one question:<br>
<br>
	According to the Cash Flow report -- the payment is noted from &quot;Williams Energy Services Company&quot;, do we know for a fact that the monies relate to ENA's relationship with Williams Production RMT????<br>
<br>

The above attached file contains validation of payment from:<br>
<br>
Cross Oil's on 3/5/02 for the full demand letter amount<br>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric on 3/5/02 for the full demand letter amount<br>
Stone Energy Corporation on 3/6/02 for the full demand letter amount<br>
Williams Production RMT on 3/5/02 for an amount considerably larger than the demand letter amount ($0.75M paid vs. $0.64 demand)<br>
<br>
Please update the Demand Letter Log to reflect that their payment was received.  No termination letter will go to these CPs at this time.  <br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

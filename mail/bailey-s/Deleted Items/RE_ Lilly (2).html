Dona,<br>
<br>
I had really great time, and hope the remainder of your weekend went well.<br>
<br>
I would love to join you all this week for drinks with the girls, just let me know the evening.<br>
<br>
I usually see my trainer on Tuesday &amp; Thursday, but could skip Thursday if that would be one of the drink nights.<br>
<br>
Also Bear &amp; I would love to go walking again sometime before Lilly leaves.<br>
<br>

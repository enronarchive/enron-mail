Subject:	Bin Laden<br>

The following was received from a friend:<br>
<br>
Most of us remember the Oliver North hearings, but do not recall the name<br>
of Osama bin Laden as the terrorist that North was threatened by. It's<br>
pretty evident in hindsight that we should have listened to Ollie!<br>
In a recent university lecture the other day they played a video of<br>
Oliver North during the Iran-Contra deals during the Reagan<br>
administration.<br>
<br>
There was Ollie in front of God and Country getting the third degree. But<br>
what he said was stunning. He was being grilled by some senator who asked<br>
him; 'Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security<br>
system?'<br>
<br>
Oliver replied, 'Yes I did sir.'<br>
<br>
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, 'Isn't<br>
this just a little excessive?'<br>
<br>
'No sir,' continued Oliver.<br>
<br>
'No. And why not?'<br>
<br>
'Because the life of my family and I were threatened.'<br>
<br>
'Threatened? By who.'<br>
<br>
'By a terrorist, sir.'<br>
<br>
'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?'<br>
<br>
'His name is Osama bin Laden.'<br>
<br>
At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't<br>
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of<br>
people laughed at the attempt and then the senator continued.<br>
'Why are you so afraid of this man?'<br>
<br>
'Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of.'<br>
<br>
'And what do you recommend we do about him?'<br>
<br>
'If it were me I would recommend an assassin team be formed to eliminate<br>
him and his men from the face of the earth.' The senator disagreed with<br>
this approach and that was the end of the video clip.<br>
<br>
It's scary when you think 15 years ago the government was aware of Osama<br>
bin Laden and his potential threat to the security of the world. I guess<br>
like all great tyrants they start small but if left untended spread like<br>
the virus they truly are.&quot;<br>

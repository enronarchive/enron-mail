Cutiest,<br>
<br>
Sorry for my absence -- but we have both been extremely busy lately with all the meetings going on.  However, I just wanted you to know that you are always in my thoughts, even though we may not see each other.<br>
<br>
I have wanted to contact you for days, but there was never a free or good moment.  Most of my group is gone this afternoon, so I had a chance to drop a line and check on  how you are fairing.<br>
<br>
I have received the news on the Boss and hope you are being taken care of -- since you have been a team for almost 25 years.    Please lets not lose touch -- you &amp; I have shared many good &amp; bad times together and I do not want to lose my only &quot;sister&quot;.<br>
<br>
Love you,<br>
<br>
Sciullo<br>

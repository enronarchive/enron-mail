22 things all dogs need to know<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. The garbage collector is not stealing my stuff.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 2. I do not need to suddenly stand straight up when I'm lying under<br>
&gt; the coffee table.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 3. If I roll my toys behind the fridge or behind the sofa, they're<br>
&gt; gone.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 4. I can shake the rainwater out of my fur BEFORE I enter the house.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 5. I should not eat the cat's food, either before they eat it or after<br>
&gt; they throw it up.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 6. It is not necessary to find the few remaining pieces of clean<br>
&gt; carpet in the house when I am about to get sick. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 7. The bathroom wastebasket is not a cookie jar. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 8. I should not chew my human's toothbrush and not tell them. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 9. If I chew crayons or pens, especially the red ones, my people will<br>
&gt; think I'm hemorrhaging. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 10. When in the car, I should not insist on having the window rolled<br>
&gt; down when it's raining outside. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 11. Since we do not have a doorbell, I don't have to bark each time I<br>
&gt; hear one on TV.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 12. I should not steal my Mom's underwear and dance all over the<br>
&gt; backyard with it.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 13. The sofa is not a face towel.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 14. My head does not belong in the refrigerator.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 15. I should not bite the officer's hand when he reaches in for Mom's<br>
&gt; driver's license and car registration.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 16. I should not play tug-of-war with dad's underwear when he's on the<br>
&gt; toilet.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 17. If I eat mint-flavored dental floss out of the bathroom garbage,<br>
&gt; my people will think I have worms when they see a string hanging out<br>
&gt; of my butt.<br>
&gt; 18. I am not obligated to roll around in the dirt immediately after a<br>
&gt; bath. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 19. The toilet bowl is not a never-ending water supply.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 20. Sticking my nose into someone's crotch is not an acceptable way of<br>
&gt; saying hello. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 21. The cat is not a squeaky toy, so when I play with him and he makes<br>
&gt; that noise, it's probably not a good thing. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 22. Cat turds are not dog candy. <br>
&gt; <br>

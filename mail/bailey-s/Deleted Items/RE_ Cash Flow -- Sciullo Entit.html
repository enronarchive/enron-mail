Dan,<br>
<br>
I agree as to your decision to complete the reimbursment for cell phones for year 2001.<br>
<br>
However, I will NOT use the Four Star card for gasoline purchases any longer, since Mr. D was opposed to this practice.<br>
<br>
Hey -- have a HAPPY THANKSGIVING.<br>
<br>
Love you.<br>

I hear you Susan, but that is nickels and dimes.  In the scheme of things it is small. I think we should at least reiburse ourselves for phones etc through 12/31/01.  Otherwise, we lose two ways: (1) we don't get the money back and (2) the amounts are not deductible by anyone. We need to keep our eyes on taxes deuctions too. So that is my view.<br>

I have reviewed your (as always through) summary of events, as well as<br>
having reviewed the cash flow ledgers.  With respect to the saving of<br>
funds -- I would suggest that you &amp; I no longer charge our gasoline<br>
usage to Four Star, nor reimburse ourselves for our cell phone usage.<br>
<br>
As you know, Mr. Donato did not approve of the gasoline charges w/ the<br>
Four Star credit card, especially in light of the fact that Four Star<br>
does not own either of our cars/vehicles.<br>
<br>
Let me know about the gasoline and cell phone thoughts.<br>
<br>
Love you.  <br>
<br>

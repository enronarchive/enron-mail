Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  <br>
<br>
In a press release, Ken said, &quot;I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.&quot;<br>
<br>
He added, &quot;My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board.&quot;<br>

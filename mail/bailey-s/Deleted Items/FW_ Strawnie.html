<br>
I just talked to Allison and Strawnie is out of ICU and in his own room. <br>
 He is still heavily sedated, but doing much better.  They are doing <br>
surgery on his arm and hand (left) tomorrow to close it up.  He will have <br>
to have more surgery when he gets home.  They are hoping to come home <br>
Monday evening if all continues to go well.  I asked her about phone calls <br>
to Strawnie and she said as soon as he is able to talk on the phone, he <br>
will call me.  So I will let you all know as soon as I hear from him.<br>

Just wanted to give you all Strawnie's hotel address in case you wanted to <br>
send a card or something.  He is still in ICU at this point, so he cannot <br>
have flowers or plants in his room.   If flowers or plants are sent, they <br>
will keep them at the nurses' station until he goes into his own room.   He <br>
can receive balloons though.<br>
<br>
Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center<br>
1719 E. 19th Ave.<br>
Denver, CO  80218<br>
<br>
He is in ICU, Pod D<br>
<br>
The hospital phone number is 303/839-6891.<br>

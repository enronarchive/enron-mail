I thought I noticed a Senior designation and thought it kind of strange.  <br>
<br>
Yes, all the documents were provided to E&amp;Y in hard copy form in the binders delivered to Raj last week.  The only document not included was the Florida Power &amp; Light Company (&quot;FPL&quot;) agreement.   However, under the EWS-CCT address you now possess all the Master Netting Agreements (including the FPL agreement) in the electronic/pdf format.    <br>
<br>
If you want to present E&amp;Y with the electronic/pdf versions, you will need to do that.<br>

Thank you for sending all those emails to the EWS-CCT address.  I noticed that the Ed Hlopak you sent the original emails to was the Ed, Sr - my father.  He used to work at EE&amp;CC.<br>
<br>
Have these files already been sent to E&amp;Y?  If not, I'll get it done right away.<br>
<br>

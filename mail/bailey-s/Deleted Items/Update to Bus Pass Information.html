Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as &quot;taxable&quot; income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as &quot;imputed tax&quot;. See example below<br>
<br>
Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. <br>
<br>
Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00<br>
Exclusion amount			$  65.00<br>
<br>
Taxable Income amount		$  35.00<br>

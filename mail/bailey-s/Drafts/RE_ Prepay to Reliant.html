I have checked the Termination files for all Reliant entities and there is no such Letter of Termination in connection with a GISB.  <br>
<br>
There is however, a Master Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement dated effective as of November 8, 2001, which covers several Reliant entities and several Enron entities, as well as several underlying agreements.  This agreement however does not specifically cover a GISB.  It however, does cover the following physical type contracts:<br>
<br>
	1.	Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement dated effective November 1, 2000 with ENA (ENA Enfolio Master Agreement);<br>
	2.	Master &quot;Spot&quot; Purchase/Sale Agreement dated effective January 1, 1996 with ENA(ENA Enfolio Master Spot 			Agreement);<br>
	3.	Gas Purchase/Sale Transaction Confirmation with ENA Upstream (Upstream Gas Confirmations); and<br>
	4.	Master Firm Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement dated effective as of September 15, 1999 with ECC (ECC Master Agreement)<br>

Reliant has agreed to sell us gas on Florida.  My trading contact is Jim Taylor (713-207-1482).  The contact on the wire should be Pete Torres (713-207-1471), he is in Reliant's credit department.  Pete said there should be an active GISB contract with Reliant already in place.  I would like to prepay for 5 days and I have my calculation on the prepay request form. <br>
<br>
Please let me know if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

Brent has reviewed the Assignment and suggests that we use of form of Assignment.  Reason being that the last B of A deal (when using their document), which involved a similar scenario was abit confusing.<br>
<br>
Brent said our form will be with PCS as assignor rather than ENA.  ENA   <br>

PCS Nitrogen would like to assign their positions with Enron over to Bank of America.  The structure of the deal would be for B of A to step in between Enron and PCS.  Currently, PCS is out of the money to Enron.  This trade would lower B of A's exposure to Enron.    I would like to give an answer to PCS today.  Could you please review and let me know how we proceed o n this assignment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Attached is a sample assignment agreement sent to us by Bank of America.<br>
It was one they had used with another deal, and has not been customized for<br>
our particular situation.  As I understand Bank of America's verbal intent<br>
is to have Bank of America step in between the obligations of our two<br>
companies.<br>

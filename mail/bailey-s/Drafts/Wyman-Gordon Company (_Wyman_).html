A Demand Letter with accompanying Invoices were sent to Wyman, for various natural gas swaps.  However, in reviewing our termination files and the Master Termination Log, I noted that a Letter dated January 9, 2002 was sent by Wyman proposing a settlement of the following invoiced deals:<br>
<br>
				QR9712.1<br>
				QS2931.1<br>
				VH5025.1<br>
				QT0050.1<br>
				QR6422.1<br>
				V42902.1<br>
<br>
This Letter was presented to me by Todd Black (ENA trader); who said (a) the invoices Wyman was returning were &quot;correctly calculated&quot;, and (b) the settlement offer of $500,000 was less not satisfactory.   Louis -- You may want to talk to Todd Black and discuss this settlement proposal with him???<br>
<br>
I also noted that one of the invoiced deals (VK6398.1), which went out with our Demand Letter was not included in the Wyman Letter of January 9, 2002 -- however, this deal appears to go out till October 2002 (according to a Deal Ticket attached hereto), yet no confirmation could be located in our LiveLink system.  Angelo -- Do you have a copy of the Confirmation (GTC) for Deal No. VK6398.1???<br>

Sorry i could not join you Sunday - Bear needed her bath.  I give her a bath in the morning, so by mid-afternoon she is dry.  Her breeder &amp; doctor suggested we refrain from evening baths--so she does not go to bed wet. In fact part of her Sunday includes an afternoon walk.<br>
<br>
Lunch @ Little Pappasito's on Saturday would be great.  Lets shoot for that.<br>

I will tell Lilly that you are up to walking.  If we can all have lunch at<br>
Little Pappasitto's that would  be great.  Whatever you think.  I always<br>
love seeing you.  Lilly and I walked by ourselves on Sunday morning.  David<br>
had t work.<br>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:   Monday, April 23, 2001<br>
<br>
     HOUSTON - EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), an S&amp;P 500 Index company, today<br>
reported record first quarter net income available to common of $212.5<br>
million, or $1.79 per share compared to net income available to common of<br>
$38.8 million, or $.33 per share in the first quarter a year ago.<br>
<br>
     &quot;At a time when the industry as a whole is struggling to maintain flat<br>
gas production, EOG increased U.S. natural gas production by over seven<br>
percent.  This demonstrates our ability to continue to grow our production<br>
organically,&quot; said Mark G. Papa, chairman and chief executive officer.<br>
&quot;Our operations and drilling inventory are in the best shape ever; we are<br>
off to a great start in 2001.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Versus the same quarter a year ago, EOG's North American daily natural<br>
gas production increased 4.2 percent, crude and condensate production<br>
increased 7.4 percent and natural gas liquids production decreased 31.4<br>
percent.  This resulted in overall EOG North American production growth of<br>
approximately four percent, consistent with the 2001 full year target.<br>
Based on shares outstanding, production per share increased approximately<br>
five percent in North America.<br>
<br>
     &quot;EOG has significantly ramped up its North American activity,&quot; Papa<br>
noted.  &quot;Over the last year, our acreage position (including trades) has<br>
increased over 50 percent, our geological and geophysical headcount has<br>
grown by over 20 percent and EOG currently has 50 percent more rigs<br>
drilling than this time last year.  To position EOG for the future, North<br>
American capital expenditures increased during the first quarter to $185.0<br>
million, compared to $85.3 million in the first quarter 2000.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Results from the quarter further solidify EOG's focus on organic<br>
growth and its long-term financial strategy.  EOG continued to strengthen<br>
its financial structure with the following:<br>
<br>
        Reduced the number of common shares outstanding by approximately<br>
        700,000 to 116.2 million,<br>
<br>
        Paid down $214.1 million of debt, reducing the debt to total<br>
        capitalization ratio from 38.3 percent at year end 2000 to 29.6<br>
        percent at the end of the first quarter 2001 and<br>
<br>
        Increased the annual common dividend by 14 percent from $.14 to<br>
        $.16 per share.<br>
<br>
     EOG's first quarter conference call will be available via live audio<br>
webcast at 9:30 a.m. Central Time (10:30 a.m. Eastern Time) on Monday,<br>
April 23, 2001.  To listen to this webcast, log on to www.eogresources.com.<br>

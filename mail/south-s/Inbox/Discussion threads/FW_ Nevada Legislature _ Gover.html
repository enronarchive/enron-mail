&gt; Subject: Nevada Legislature &amp; Governor Approves SB 369<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Late Wednesday, the Nevada Legislature approved Assembly Bill 369.  Nevada<br>
&gt; Governor Kenny Guinn signed it into law Wednesday night.  Following is the<br>
&gt; text of a news release from Sierra Pacific Resources distributed tonight.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Emergency energy bill called a decisive step<br>
&gt; To protect Nevada consumers from western power crisis<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Las Vegas - Saying that Nevada has taken the kind of decisive step<br>
&gt; required by the western energy crisis, Nevada utility officials today<br>
&gt; applauded the Nevada Legislature and Governor Kenny Guinn for their rapid<br>
&gt; action on emergency legislation that will assure the continued<br>
&gt; creditworthiness of the utilities while protecting consumers from<br>
&gt; unexpected rate hikes.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  The Nevada Legislature today passed Assembly Bill 369, which allows<br>
&gt; the utilities to recover their soaring costs for wholesale power over<br>
&gt; time.  The bill's deferred accounting method eases fears of rate hikes<br>
&gt; during the summer but assures lenders, investors and power suppliers the<br>
&gt; utilities will continue to meet their financial obligations. The bill also<br>
&gt; repeals electric deregulation in Nevada and places a moratorium on the<br>
&gt; sale of power plants in the state.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;  &quot;This was a bold move by the legislature and the governor to focus<br>
&gt; on the real problem that threatened every consumer and business in<br>
&gt; Nevada,&quot; said Walt Higgins, chairman, president and CEO of Sierra Pacific<br>
&gt; Resources, the parent company for the state's two largest utilities,<br>
&gt; Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power Company.  &quot;There were many<br>
&gt; investors, power developers, citizens and potential business prospects who<br>
&gt; have been waiting to see if Nevada would deal with this issue - and they<br>
&gt; now have their answer.&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;   &quot;This is an elegant solution that protects consumers from sticker<br>
&gt; shock by delaying and spreading any increases out over time, while<br>
&gt; offering our business partners the immediate assurance that our<br>
&gt; creditworthiness is strong,&quot; Higgins added.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; The measure passed both the Senate and Assembly today and was signed into<br>
&gt; law by Governor Guinn.  As an emergency measure, it is effective<br>
&gt; immediately.  Under the provisions of the legislation, rates would be<br>
&gt; continued at their April 1, 2001, levels, reflecting all recent increases<br>
&gt; to date, and remain stable until early next year, at which time they would<br>
&gt; be adjusted to reflect the actual costs of wholesale power and fuel over<br>
&gt; that period.  If wholesale costs remain high, the legislation allows for<br>
&gt; the rates to be spread out over several years.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &quot;We're gratified by the action taken by the Legislature and Governor on<br>
&gt; behalf of consumers in Nevada,&quot; Higgins said.<br>

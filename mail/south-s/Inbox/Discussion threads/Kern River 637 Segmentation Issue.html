Report from yesterday's technical conference.  FYI, Kern River originally <br>
argued that there is no viable segmentation opportunity on its system because <br>
there are currently no gas supply sources available to its shippers between <br>
the Utah and Nevada markets to source a segmented transport.  After a <br>
technical conference last October, Kern River did file a segmentation <br>
proposal, but I'm not sure how much value it would have as a practical <br>
matter.  Note the Southwest Gas arguments (summarized in #3 below) for <br>
allowing backhauls from California to Las Vegas under a segmented agreement.<br>

Subject: Kern River 637 Segmentation Issue<br>
<br>
Becky,<br>
<br>
I did attend this morning's Kern River technical conference in Docket No. <br>
RP00-337 at FERC.  The discussion was only on the segmentation proposal made <br>
by Kern River.  They have filed pro forma tariff sheets to allow:<br>
segmenting of firm contracts at any point<br>
segmentation and release<br>
subject to a limitation of MD at any overlapping points<br>
backhaul from supply pooling points or points where gas is physically received<br>
sets out secondary priorities for transportation within the path and outside <br>
the path<br>
<br>
After Kern River made this pro forma filing, there were two protests by <br>
Dynegy and Southwest Gas.  Kern River discussed these protests at this <br>
technical conference in attempt to resolve all issues.<br>
<br>
1.  Kern River agreed with Dynegy's point that a segmenting shipper should <br>
retain primary rights to mainline capacity when using points within the <br>
original contract path or even when outside of path but the mainline <br>
constraint remains the same as within the path.<br>
<br>
However, after determining priorities on mainline capacity, if constraints <br>
occur at specific new points in the segmented transaction, then the <br>
transaction could be given secondary priority based on the receipt or <br>
delivery point capacity.<br>
<br>
Indicated Shippers needed to be assured that their capacity to Wheeler would <br>
not be diminished due to this new policy.  Kern River responded that this is <br>
how they have always treated flex points and that because Wheeler was a <br>
constrained point, any segmented transactions that used Wheeler (new) would <br>
be secondary to the current rights (not on the basis of mainline but on the <br>
basis of the delivery point scheduling).<br>
<br>
2.  In response to Southwest's first issue, Kern River also agreed to make <br>
changes to provide parity between segmentation for release and segmentation <br>
for a shipper's own use of transportation.  If a shipper segments a contract, <br>
it can get additional primary receipt or delivery point capacity within the <br>
path if it is available from the pipeline.<br>
<br>
It was also noted that a shipper can segment a contract that goes from A to C <br>
into two transactions - A to B and then a backhaul from C to B.  In doing <br>
this, since there is no overlapping of mainline capacity, both transactions <br>
can be at the original MDQ.  The result could be double the MDQ at the new <br>
delivery point B.  This seems very flexible of Kern River and perhaps more <br>
than many other pipelines currently are willing to offer.  <br>
<br>
3.  The last issue raised by Southwest was the controversial one and was not <br>
resolved at today's technical conference.  Southwest wants to use its firm <br>
transportation contract on Kern River through segmenting to backhaul from <br>
Wheeler Ridge delivery point or from PG&amp;E delivery point to Las Vegas.  Kern <br>
River currently will provide this kind of service only on a IT basis - a <br>
separate service to Southwest.  They claim that this cannot be provided on a <br>
firm basis.  Southwest states that this is displacement service and barring <br>
insufficient deliveries at Wheeler or PG&amp;E (very unlikely, according to <br>
Southwest), could be provided under their firm contract.  They are willing to <br>
take the risk that the capacity would not be available if Kern does not have <br>
enough forward haul to Wheeler or PG&amp;E.<br>
<br>
Indicated Shippers claimed that this is similar to a service provided by <br>
Transwestern; however Transwestern offered this as a pipeline firm service.  <br>
Kern River claims that it does not and cannot offer this backhaul as a firm <br>
service.  Kern River also argued that per GISB once gas is scheduled on a <br>
firm contract to a secondary point that it is considered firm.  IT can be <br>
bumped intraday and this backhaul service may be bumped.<br>
<br>
Mirant also supported Southwest on this issue because they know of some power <br>
plants in the Las Vegas area being built that could use this kind of service.<br>
<br>
Kern River maintained that this service is not required by Order No. 637.<br>
<br>
Kern River will file changes to the pro forma tariff by May 15.  Comments by <br>
the parties are due June 1 and Kern River can file in reply by June 11.  <br>
Comments should be emailed to the parties.<br>

Enron announces UNLIMITED discounted AstroWorld tickets for employees.<br>
<br>
Due to overwhelming employee feedback, we have negotiated unlimited <br>
discounted AstroWorld tickets for you and your family in place of the <br>
traditional &quot;Enron Day At AstroWorld.&quot;  We hope this will allow Enron <br>
families to plan their fun-filled summer trips to AstroWorld at their own <br>
convenience.  Enron AstroWorld tickets are $20.56 (Retail $50), which <br>
includes admission for one, plus a $7 meal ticket to one of five restaurants <br>
at AstroWorld.<br>
<br>
Six Flags AstroWorld is a world-class family entertainment complex filled <br>
with exciting rides and attractions, including 10 heart-pounding coasters, <br>
over  40 blockbuster shows, interactive street entertainers and star-studded <br>
concerts.  Enron families will be able to purchase unlimited tickets for use <br>
anytime during the 2001 season.<br>
<br>
Tickets will be on sale at Enron's Federal Credit Union, EB0399.  Visit the <br>
credit union in person to make your purchases.  AstroWorld tickets will not <br>
be mailed.  Enron employees who are not already Enron FCU members may pay by <br>
cash or money order only.  All Enron Employees are encouraged to take <br>
advantage of this great summer fun deal and may purchase tickets through <br>
August 30th.<br>

<br>
Enron Global LNG<br>
Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global <br>
wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States <br>
and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for <br>
LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in <br>
serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. <br>
energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can <br>
supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world,s growing appetite <br>
for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for <br>
Enron,s wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy <br>
market.<br>

Isabel,<br>
I just sent the support for the volume cuts.  I also spoke with my trader<br>
and she called Steve South at your company.  Steve confirmed that the price<br>
for the 6th - 31st was Malin gas daily.<br>
Let me know if there is anything else you need.<br>
Thanks,<br>
Hilary<br>

&gt; I have not received the pipe support that you said you were going to send.<br>
&gt; Please send the support so that I can get the volumes corrected.<br>
&gt; Also, I have not heard from the trader regarding the NGI malin price.<br>
&gt; Have<br>
&gt; you asked your trader?<br>
&gt; Please, we need to get this down to a reasonable dollar amount.  According<br>
&gt; to our records Barrett still owes Enron 1 mil. dollars.<br>
&gt; I appreciate you sending that pipe support as soon as posible so that I<br>
&gt; can<br>
&gt; get the corrections rolling.<br>
&gt; thanks<br>

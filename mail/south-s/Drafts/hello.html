Ejner-- Since I am UBSW Energy I have been informed all my investments must be done through UBS. Can I use you or am I better off to use a Houston paine webber guy. I have a Paine Webber guy that I sold Enron options through as Enron had a deal set up with Paine Webber, but he seems to be more of a salesman than an investment strategist.<br>
<br>
On another note Linda,Pete and their 4 kids along with Laurie and my mom and dad are all coming here for Easter. Hopefully a little golf and an Easter egg hunt.Tell your dad I'm still looking for a Brett Farve potser to update his room. Maybee he would rather have our new Houston Texan star Jamie Sharper. Hope all is well.<br>

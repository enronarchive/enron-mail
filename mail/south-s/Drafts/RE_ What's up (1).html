I have the same opinion about my daughter getting soft.  That is why for<br>
the past two winters, I have made her build and live in her own igloo in<br>
the back yard.  She did ok with that. It was the tracking and killing the<br>
deer for her meals that gave her problems intitially.<br>
<br>
Got to spend over $150 on track shoes and softball cleats for her the other<br>
night.  I love sports.  I can't imagine how much time and money you guys<br>
have to put in.<br>

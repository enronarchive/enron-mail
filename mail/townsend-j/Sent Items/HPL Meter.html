Subject: HPL Meter<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the message I received from my technical folks. (below in red).<br>
As you can see a lot of work is involved.  Let me know how much you would<br>
plan to nominate at this point, etc.    And can they committ to a certain,<br>
volume, etc.   Also,  have they talked to HPL about taking gas at this<br>
point.<br>
<br>
<br>
After visiting the site (M&amp;R 71886/76886), I found the following work that<br>
would need to be done before custody transfer measurement could be<br>
performed :<br>
 (The site has two 12&quot; meter runs with valve switching (bidirectional flow)<br>
and run switching - and has not flow gas in over 10 years)<br>
<br>
1. All valves will need to be inspected &amp; overhauled<br>
     A. Run switching valve - major overhaul (needs to be sent off for this<br>
work)<br>
     B. Control valves - inspected &amp; overhauled (needs to be sent off for<br>
this work)<br>
     C. Small regulators overhauled<br>
2. Both meter tubes pulled and inspected<br>
     A. Sr. fitting needs to be overhauled<br>
     B. Tubes will need to be honed (needs to be sent off to have fitting<br>
overhauled and tubes honed)<br>
3. All transmitter need to be replaced<br>
     A. Differential - 2<br>
     B. Temperature - 2 (1 additional from original setup)<br>
     C. Pressure - 4<br>
     D. Direct mount manifolds - 2<br>
     E. UPS system<br>
4. RTU boards need to be furnished<br>
     A. Mother board<br>
     B. STI REM<br>
     C. Main terminal board<br>
     D. Serial IO LEM<br>
     E. Analog Output board<br>
5. New batteries ( 4 @ $ 160)<br>
6. Two sets of orifice plates (In .50&quot; increments through Beta range)<br>
<br>
It would take at least 1.5 months to re-work the station controls and<br>
associated valves, meter runs, and EGM.  If you need more information<br>
please let me know.<br>

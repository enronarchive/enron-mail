Subject: EnronOptions - Your Stock Option Program<br>
<br>
It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the <br>
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recognize <br>
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron,s business goals, and we are <br>
pleased that many of you have shared in the company,s financial success <br>
through Enron stock options. <br>
<br>
As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as the <br>
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided value <br>
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this <br>
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of <br>
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the <br>
program.   <br>
<br>
Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package <br>
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron,s continued <br>
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and <br>
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decided <br>
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.<br>
<br>
On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for <br>
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program).  It is <br>
expected that EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program will be granted, <br>
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligible <br>
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to <br>
final approval by Enron,s Board of Directors, is as follows:<br>
<br>
Â£ EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to <br>
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and <br>
international companies/locations.<br>
Â£ The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base <br>
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on <br>
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some <br>
international locations.)<br>
Â£ The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.<br>
Â£ Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant <br>
of stock options.<br>
<br>
Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option <br>
Program, among other good reasons( that,s why.<br>
<br>
In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions ) <br>
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your questions, <br>
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host <br>
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular <br>
basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact your <br>
Human Resources representative. <br>
<br>
Note: In addition to final approval by Enron,s Board of Directors, granting <br>
of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal <br>
regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions ) Your Stock <br>
Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enron <br>
companies, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, labor <br>
or business issues.  As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the <br>
marketplaces we serve.  Given that need to change, we will continue to refine <br>
the eligibility for EnronOptions ) Your Stock Option Program and will <br>
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being <br>
determined on December 29, 2000.  <br>

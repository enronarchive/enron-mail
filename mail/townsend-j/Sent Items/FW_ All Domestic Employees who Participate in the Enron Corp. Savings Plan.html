Â·	Request a loan or a loan payoff so that funds can be allocated or distributed in time.<br>

<br>
For SDA Participants, Friday, October 19 at 3:00pm CST will be your last day to:<br>

Â·	Re-invest any Schwab mutual funds into your choice of funds  - the default will be your money market fund.<br>
<br>

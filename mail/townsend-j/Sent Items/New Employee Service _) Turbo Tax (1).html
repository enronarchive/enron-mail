Q.  What is the Automated Tax Return (ATR) service?<br>
A. Intuit Inc., makers of the popular Quicken TurboTax tax preparation and <br>
filing software, have launched a new Automated Tax Return (ATR) service to <br>
simplify tax preparation for TurboTax users. ATR allows users of TurboTax tax <br>
preparation and filing software to import tax information from multiple <br>
sources such as employers, brokerage houses, and mutual fund companies <br>
directly into the correct TurboTax forms over the Internet.  Since our <br>
payroll tax provider, ProBusiness, has partnered with Intuit to provide this <br>
service, you will be able to electronically download your individual W-2 data <br>
from ProBusiness directly into TurboTax through the Internet for free. Also, <br>
as part of this program, you can receive a  5% discount on all TurboTax and <br>
Quicken products including shipping and handling (go to <br>
www.probusinesstaxes.com for more information).<br>

Q. So how does it work?<br>
A. Embedded in each version of TurboTax 2000 (both the software and web <br>
application) is a series of screens that will ask whether your employer <br>

free service, simply answer &quot;yes&quot; then select our payroll tax provider, <br>
ProBusiness, from a drop-down list of providers which includes ProBusiness, <br>
PeopleSoft, Ceridian, and seemyw2.com.  Validate your request by entering <br>
your social security number and W-2 box one data and your W-2 data will <br>
automatically transfer via the Internet into the appropriate locations in the <br>
TurboTax form.<br>
<br>
Q. Is this a secure transaction?<br>
A.  Intuit,s TurboTax ATR service combines Open Financial Exchange (OFX), the <br>
standard technology used in e-finance, with 128-bit military-grade encryption <br>
to create an advanced security protocol that ensures the highest level of <br>
security and confidentiality when obtaining financial data to populate your <br>
TurboTax form over the Internet.<br>
<br>
Q. How do I participate in this program? <br>
A.  Only employees using Intuit,s TurboTax 2000 tax preparation and filing <br>
software can take advantage of this Web-based ATR service.  TurboTax software <br>
and the ATR Web-based filing service can be accessed at <br>
www.probusinesstaxes.com.<br>
<br>

A. Yes, all copies of TurboTax 2000 contain the Automated Tax Return service <br>
option.<br>
<br>

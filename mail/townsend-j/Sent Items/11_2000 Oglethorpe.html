Hi Judy,<br>
<br>
I spoke with Chris Germany yesterday and he said that you were going to take <br>
care of fixing the Oglethorpe deal.  An unhappy Doug Jones from Oglethorpe <br>
called me yesterday.  He is wanting to get the corrected invoice ASAP so he <br>
can have the wire to us before year end.  If he doesn't get the invoice <br>
today, he will not pay us until after the first of the year.  <br>
<br>
Please let me know when to expect the changes to come across so I can forcast <br>
the cash receipt in our system for treasury and also let Doug know when the <br>
invoice will be faxed over to him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone involved for all of your help.  Merry Christmas!<br>
<br>
Darla<br>

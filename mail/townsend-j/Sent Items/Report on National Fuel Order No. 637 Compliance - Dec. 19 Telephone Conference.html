Conference<br>
<br>
FYI.  At the last technical conference, National Fuel agreed to provide two <br>
hours notice on intra-day recalls, up from their one-hour proposal.  We will <br>
track their filing to make sure they don't file something else.<br>

Conference<br>
<br>
<br>
David Reitz of National Fuel indicated that the pipeline is back to its <br>
position before the last technical conference with regard to keeping the TBF <br>
fee a part of the imbalance resolution process as opposed to making it a <br>
separate service.  As a fall back position, National Fuel will seek guidance <br>
from FERC as to whether it should be made into a new service.  To make PA OCA <br>
happy, David Reitz indicated that any future proposal will incorporate the <br>
50-50 sharing that is in the current proposal.<br>
<br>
National Fuel plans to make a revised pro forma tariff filing in mid-January <br>
and inform FERC that this filing resulted from the collaborative effort of <br>
parties to the proceeding.  The filing will have reservation of rights <br>
language that preserves National Fuel's right to file something completely <br>
different when it files to place the revised tariff sheets into effect.  <br>
Prior to making the filing, National Fuel will circulate the explanatory <br>
transmittal letter and pro forma tariff sheets, and will flag any changes <br>
made to the pro forma tariff sheets.  This pre-filing circulation should <br>
occur some time during the first two weeks in January.<br>
<br>
Nothing was said about the intra-day recall provisions.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;Rebecca.W.Cantrell@enron.com&gt; 12/18/00 03:39PM &gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Yes, please.  I have another meeting, so I probably won't be able to dial<br>
in.  What are the directions, just in case?<br>
<br>
Let me know if they try to make any changes in the intraday recall<br>
provisions.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

      Conference<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you want us to participate in the telephone conference tomorrowat 10:00<br>
Eastern time?  I haven't seen any revised tariff sheets, so I'm not quite<br>
sure what will be discussed besides National Fuel's decision not to make<br>
the TBF service a separate service.<br>

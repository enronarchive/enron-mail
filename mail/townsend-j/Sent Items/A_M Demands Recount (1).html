&gt; College Station, TX (AP) - R.C. Slocum and the Texas A&amp;M Aggies are<br>
&gt; demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma<br>
&gt; won 35 to 31. &quot;The end zones were confusing,&quot; says Slocum. &quot;I'm sure that<br>
&gt; some of the touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go<br>
&gt; into ours. We were scoring in those end zones also.  Oklahoma would never<br>
&gt; have scored thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&amp;M<br>
&gt; demands<br>
&gt; a recount.&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Oklahoma officials are calling this &quot;outrageous&quot;.  &quot;They agreed to the<br>
&gt; size,<br>
&gt; shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,&quot; replies OU coach<br>
&gt; Bob Stoops.  &quot;If they had a problem with them, they should have said so<br>
&gt; before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with<br>
&gt; the<br>
&gt; outcome. Someone had to lose. We've scored over thirty-five points many<br>
&gt; times.&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; A&amp;M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well<br>
&gt; as<br>
&gt; Reville down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.<br>
&gt; &quot;We<br>
&gt; are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner<br>
&gt; of<br>
&gt; the game,&quot; says Slocum.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end<br>
&gt; zones<br>
&gt; were used. &quot;They didn't have a problem with the end<br>
&gt; zones until they lost,&quot; says Stoops.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Outside of Kyle Field, A&amp;M student protesters have gathered bearing signs<br>
&gt; such as, &quot;A&amp;M wants a fair game!<br>
&gt; WHOOOOOOP!&quot;  Students' thoughts echoed their signs. &quot;All we want is a<br>
fair<br>
&gt; total of the points before we declare a winner,&quot; says student Karen Hays,<br>
&gt; an<br>
&gt; Aggie from Marfa. &quot;We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment<br>
&gt; before we declare a winner.&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ABC, around 2:00pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&amp;M the winner,<br>
&gt; despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at<br>
&gt; that point. At about 2:30 pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC<br>
&gt; had<br>
&gt; to back off its prediction.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; College Football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. &quot;We felt that<br>
with<br>
&gt; a<br>
&gt; number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs<br>
&gt; and the Aggies, we were certain A&amp;M would carry this game. We may have<br>
&gt; been<br>
&gt; premature in our prediction.&quot;<br>

Hi Connie,<br>
<br>
I was just asking Scott H. about Melissa...I thought she was due in December.  He said you might be staying.  Did she know it was a boy? Everything go well?  Now you have two beautiful grandchildren!!  Baby Kyle missed Rob's birthday by one day....Rob's is today!  <br>
<br>
Hope things are going well for you.  I'm still here.  I don't know for how long...sounds like we may know something by tomorrow????  Don't know for sure.<br>
Hope to talk to you soon!<br>
<br>
Judy<br>

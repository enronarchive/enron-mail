<div id=msg_body>
Following is from today's Inside FERC.  The Commission rejected Phase III b/c <br>
Transco filed contracts for 210,000dth/d, representing firm commitments,<br>
rather than for the 404,000/dth/d proposed in the original application.  The <br>
delay in filing was caused by the protracted negotiations over siting <br>
between Transco and the State of New Jersey.  The rejection leaves a gap in <br>
the capacity needed to serve the NY/NJ market and may improve the <br>
chances for success of the other proposed projects in the NYC area sponsored <br>
separately by Duke, ElPaso, Iroquois and jointly by Duke/Williams/KeySpan.<br>
<br>
Please let me know if you need any additional information.<br>

Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. will have to start the FERC approval <br>
process all over again for<br>
more than half of its originally anticipated MarketLink capacity. In an April <br>
26 order, the commission said<br>
previously granted certificate authority for 404,000 Dt/day of capacity on <br>
the expansion into the New York<br>
City metro area has expired.<br>
<br>
Earlier this month, Transco tried to persuade FERC to allow it to build <br>
sufficient facilities to move the<br>
gas it had under contract for the project,s phase three--only 210,000 Dt/day <br>
of the phase,s planned<br>
404,000 Dt/day (IF, 23 April, 4). But that request doesn,t square with the <br>
commission,s Dec. 13 approval of<br>
project phasing, said last week,s order (CP98-540). In the December ruling, <br>
the commission said that<br>
&quot;should Transco desire to construct some configuration of the remaining <br>
MarketLink facilities and<br>
services that differ[s] from what has been authorized (in the Dec. 13 order), <br>
Transco will be required to file<br>
an application for a new certificate for those facilities.&quot;<br>
<br>
As a result, Transco now has authority to build only 166,000 Dt/day of <br>
phase-one capacity, scheduled<br>
to be online Nov. 1, and 130,000 Dt/day of phase-two capacity, expected to be <br>
in service Nov. 1, 2002.<br>
<br>
&quot;As the history of the MarketLink project amply demonstrates, we authorized <br>
Transco to construct this<br>
project on the basis that the capacity was fully subscribed. Now, almost <br>
three years after Transco filed its<br>
application, one year after we certificated the project, and four months <br>
after giving Transco more time to<br>
obtain contracts, Transco still does not have a market fully subscribing <br>
phase three,&quot; said last week,s order.<br>
Transco was required to show contracts by April 13 for the full 404,000 <br>
Dt/day capacity of phase three, and<br>
when it couldn,t do so, certificate authority expired on that date, FERC said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, Transco is free to file a new application requesting certificate <br>
authority to construct and<br>
operate the facilities needed&quot; to provide phase-three service, the order <br>
added.<br>
In filings before FERC acted, the state of New York said Transco should be <br>
given the go-ahead for<br>
phase-three construction because &quot;new capacity is needed to serve growth in <br>
the traditional core market as<br>
well as the rapidly increasing demand for gas to generate electricity in the <br>
New York City area.&quot; While only<br>
a small percentage of the contracted phase-three volumes-- 25,000 Dt/day out <br>
of 210,000 Dt/day-- is<br>
designated for delivery to New York City, the shipments into the region <br>
&quot;should help to alleviate capacity<br>
constraints and bring down the high market prices that have been experienced <br>
over recent periods,&quot; the<br>
state went on to say.<br>
<br>
Expressing the contrary view, Rep. Bill Pascrell in a short but pointed <br>
letter expressed his opposition to<br>
the proposal to build downsized facilities for phase three.<br>

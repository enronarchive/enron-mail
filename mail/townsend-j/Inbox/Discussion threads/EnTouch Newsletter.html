BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS<br>
<br>
Enron Global Markets <br>
In a combined effort, Global Risk Markets (GRM), a unit of Enron Global <br>
Markets, and Southeast Power Origination, part of Enron Americas, closed <br>
Enron's first Contingent Call Outage Option in the 1st quarter 2001. The <br>
product was created to provide customers with a cost effective risk <br>
management tool to hedge against high commodity prices after experiencing an <br>
unplanned power generation outage.<br>
<br>
The transaction was entered into with UtiliCorp United to manage its <br>
generation risk for summer 2001. This risk is associated with a forced outage <br>
of their largest coal unit during peak summer demand. The transaction, which <br>
was developed jointly with the Southeast Power group, highlights the benefits <br>
of cooperation between business units within Enron. GRM is working with a <br>
number of business units to integrate this risk management product into other <br>
Enron businesses to enhance value to our customers.  For additional <br>
information on the product, please call David Hoog in the New York office at <br>

IN THE NEWS<br>
<br>
WORTH Magazine Names the Top 50 CEO's<br>
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 23, 2001--Fifty of the country's chief <br>
executive officers have been chosen by WORTH magazine as the top business <br>
leaders in the nation, it was announced by W. Randall Jones, CEO, Worth <br>
Media. <br>
The third annual listing of CEO's by WORTH is determined based on each <br>
leaders &quot;foresight, judgment, and competitive juice to make their investors <br>
happy.&quot; Rounding out the top 5 are the following best leaders:<br>
1. Steve Ballmer, CEO, Microsoft   2. Jeffrey Skilling, CEO, Enron   3. <br>
Philip Purcell, CEO, Morgan Stanley   4. James Morgan, CEO, Applied <br>
Materials   <br>
5. Margaret Whitman, CEO, eBay <br>
&quot;We selected this year's list based on our belief in the CEO's ability to <br>
deliver long-term shareholder value,&quot; said Jones. &quot;The real test is not to <br>
recognize past achievements but to be able to look back in five or ten years <br>
from now. As a matter of fact, some CEO's we've chosen haven't made money for <br>
share holders in the past few years, but we believe they are poised to do so <br>
now.&quot;  WORTH's methodology for selecting the 50 best CEO's strives to balance <br>
their possession of a vision with a demonstrated ability to execute under <br>
stress and when confronted by urgent challenges. <br>

NUGGETS &amp; NOTES<br>
<br>
Travel Tip of the Week:  Book non-refundable tickets. Airlines typically <br>
allow unused non-refundable tickets to be applied towards subsequent travel. <br>
Even if you need to make a change at a rate of $100, in many cases the change <br>
fee plus the ticket price is still less than a refundable ticket.<br>
 For example:  Houston to Washington, D.C.<br>
      Refundable:  $ 1,447<br>
      Non-refundable       $    540<br>

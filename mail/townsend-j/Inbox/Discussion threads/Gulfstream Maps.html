Subject: Gulfstream Maps<br>
<br>
Do you know anyone who would like or need detailed maps from the Final <br>
Environmental Impact Statement for Gulfstream?  I typically don't keep <br>
environmental information for projects because it takes up so much room and <br>
nobody ever asks for it.  However, this does have facility location maps of <br>
the project and various alternatives.  The full system is broken down into <br>
121 topographic maps, so it's very detailed.  This may not be the final <br>
routing, but it will be pretty close.<br>
<br>
First come, first served.  I only have one volume.<br>

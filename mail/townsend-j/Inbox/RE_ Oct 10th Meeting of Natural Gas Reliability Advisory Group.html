Frank, I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email.<br>
<br>
As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, &quot;the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great&quot; .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&amp;G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&amp;G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&amp;G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&amp;G.<br>
<br>
<br>
However, we do support intra-day capacity release.<br>

Attached is a presentation from Dynegy that answers the question of &quot; Will intra-day capacity recalls support reliability for the Provider of Last Resort in a deregulated market ?&quot;  Dynegy seems to be saying &quot;no&quot;.  KeySpan is the LDC that is suggesting that the POLR ( in their minds, KeySpan ) needs intra-day capacity recall rights to serve the market reliably.  Another question comes from this as to our larger business.  That is, Will intra-day capacity recall rights effect our business favorably or unfavorably as a whole ?  Chris and Maureen, I am interested in you thoughts on this asap.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>

<div id=msg_body>
The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the <br>
businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin <br>
number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase <br>
in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with <br>
outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 <br>
million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to <br>
tremendous contributions from each business group.<br>
<br>
In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the <br>
following changes and additions have been made within the organization. <br>
<br>
Crude and Products group<br>
Mid-marketing<br>
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused <br>
mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is <br>
responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some <br>
responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of <br>
this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product <br>
specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  <br>
<br>
Origination<br>
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, <br>
the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper <br>
focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug <br>
Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John <br>
Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union <br>
Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O,<br>
Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both <br>
Randy and Doug Leach,s growing fuels origination group will report to Randy <br>
Maffett. <br>

related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all <br>
aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in <br>
these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.<br>
<br>
Weather<br>
The weather group under Mark Tawney,s direction is expanding its efforts <br>
around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office <br>
will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from <br>
Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the <br>
continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will <br>

<br>
Enron Japan<br>
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision <br>
has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, <br>
President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  <br>
Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be <br>
increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products <br>
have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will <br>
coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their <br>
activities.<br>
<br>

resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and <br>
Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently <br>

after startup.<br>
<br>
Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation <br>
for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European <br>
market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are <br>
contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading <br>
insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with <br>
decommissioning insurance.<br>
<br>

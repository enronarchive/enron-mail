<br>
TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate<br>
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001.  Based on<br>
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,<br>
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt<br>
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to<br>
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of<br>
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual<br>
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until<br>
further notice.<br>
<br>
Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and<br>
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation<br>
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's<br>
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is<br>
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system<br>
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual<br>
imbalances left on the system.<br>
<br>
Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas<br>
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being<br>
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate<br>
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system<br>
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be<br>
accepted into the system until further notice.<br>
<br>
If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of<br>
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an<br>
operational flow order (&quot;OFO&quot;) requiring actual receipts of gas to match<br>
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO<br>
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as<br>
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take<br>
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its<br>
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.<br>
<br>

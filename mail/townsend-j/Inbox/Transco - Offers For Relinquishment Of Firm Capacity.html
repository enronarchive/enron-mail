RE: Offers For Permanent Relinquishment of Firm Capacity in<br>
Conjunction with the Leidy East Expansion Project<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line (&quot;Transco&quot;) solicits offers<br>
for the permanent relinquishment of firm transportation<br>
capacity on the Transco system. Shippers holding capacity<br>
with receipts at Leidy, PA and deliveries to Princeton<br>
Junction or mainline points in Zone 6 may offer that<br>
capacity for relinquishment, subject to the<br>
conditions outlined below.<br>
<br>
<br>
Transco intends to combine such relinquished capacity<br>
with newly constructed capacity in order to render service<br>
in Transco's Leidy East Expansion Project (&quot;Leidy East&quot;).<br>
In accordance with the Commission's order of April 26, 2001<br>
denying Transco's request for clarification of the MarketLink<br>
Order, the Leidy East project will provide service to<br>
shippers that had executed contracts that were filed with<br>
the Commission on April 13, 2001, as part of Phase 3 of the<br>
MarketLink project.  The capacity of the Leidy East project<br>
will be 130,000 Dts/d.  In order to meet the proposed in-<br>
service date of November 1, 2002, Transco plans to file<br>
a certificate application with the Commission for Leidy<br>
East by the end of June.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Offers for capacity relinquishment may be made by<br>
shippers with existing transportation services as defined<br>
above and provided under Part 284(G) of the FERC's<br>
regulations.<br>
<br>
Valid offers must meet the following criteria:<br>
<br>
1. The capacity offered must result in a reduction of the<br>
facilities otherwise required to serve the subscribing<br>
shippers in Leidy East;<br>
<br>
2. Inclusion of relinquished capacity in the project must<br>
result in a lower cost of service for the project than if<br>
additional facilities were constructed;<br>
<br>
3. The remaining contract term for the relinquished<br>
capacity must not exceed the primary contract term of<br>
service for Leidy East;<br>
<br>
4. Offers for permanent relinquishment will not be<br>
accepted from shippers who have contracted for service<br>
under Leidy East;<br>
<br>
5. Offers must identify the specific contract(s) and delivery<br>
point(s) in each contract at which delivery point entitlements<br>
(DPEs)will be reduced as a result of the relinquishment of firm<br>
capacity to those points; and<br>
<br>
6. Offers must be unconditional, binding and irrevocable.<br>
<br>
Such offers must be received by Transco no later than 5:00<br>
PM CST on Monday, May 21, 2001. After receipt of offers to<br>
relinquish capacity, Transco will make any modifications<br>
necessary to the design of the facilities to be constructed<br>
to render service in Leidy East.<br>
<br>
Parties that submit offers to relinquish capacity will be<br>
notified as to whether the offer complied with the<br>
specifications set forth herein and whether the capacity<br>
will be accepted and utilized to render service in Leidy East.<br>
If more capacity is offered than is needed in Leidy East,<br>
preference will be given to those offers which reduce the<br>
cost of Leidy East to the greatest degree. In the event of<br>
a tie, preference will next be given to those offers which<br>
have the shortest remaining term for the capacity<br>
relinquished.<br>
<br>
Shippers with relinquished capacity that is included in<br>
Leidy East will retain all rights and responsibilities set forth<br>
in their Service Agreement(s), Rate Schedule FT and the General<br>
Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff until<br>
Leidy East firm transportation service commences through the<br>
relinquished capacity.  The Leidy East firm transportation<br>
service is expected to commence on November 1, 2002.<br>
The relinquishing shipper's service agreement(s) will be<br>
terminated or reduced effective on the actual in service date.<br>
Transco's acceptance of relinquished capacity is and will be<br>
subject to the following:<br>
<br>
1. Execution and delivery by the shipper to Transco of an<br>
agreement to permanently relinquish such firm transportation<br>
capacity (such agreement to be provided by Transco);<br>
<br>
2. Execution and delivery of an amendment to the shipper's firm<br>
transportation contract reflecting any modifications resulting<br>
from the relinquishment of a portion of the service related to<br>
such capacity, if applicable;<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Receipt of a FERC certificate authorizing the proposed<br>
Leidy East facilities and service (including approval of this<br>
capacity relinquishment) in a form acceptable to Transco in its<br>
sole opinion.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the event that Leidy East does not go forward for any reason,<br>
including, without limitation, the FERC authorizations being<br>
granted in a form unacceptable to Transco, the capacity<br>
relinquishment shall not be effectuated and all related<br>
agreements shall be null and void.<br>
<br>
Parties desiring more information regarding this announcement<br>
should contact Nancy Hargrove at 713-215-2926.<br>

Hi! Glad to hear you are all doing fine. Mom is good. I am still on the northwest side of town. I bought a house last summer, which I am now trying to sell. It is a three bedroom and since James and I got married it is too small. I don't know if I mentioned it, or if Ingrid did, but he has three boys. So, we have found a 5 bedroom house in the same neighborhood, Prestonwood Forest, that we will probably buy, we just have to sell ours. Mom also bought a house in the same neighborhood last summer. She moved my Granny here from Port Arthur to live with her. She is 95. I think Mom is going to go crazy dealing with her. Mother doesn't have much patience. Let me know when you can go to lunch. I would really like to see you.<br>
See you soon, <br>
Laurie <br>

&gt; Hi Laurie, <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I was so glad to hear from you...i was thinking about you.  So much <br>
&gt; has <br>
&gt; been going on here, it's just been unreal.  You're right, I thought it <br>
&gt; was Tod when Ingrid told me you had married someone from high school. <br>
&gt; He was the only one I had known of.  Glad to hear you are doing well. <br>
&gt; How's your mom?  I think of her too.  Are you still living in the same <br>
&gt; area? <br>
&gt; I am still working part-time.  There were more lay-offs Friday. I've <br>
&gt; been taking vacation, plus I have like 2 weeks still left.  I would <br>
&gt; like <br>
&gt; to meet for lunch one day...maybe later this week. I'll call you.  My <br>
&gt; email at home is jtownse@yahoo.com and my home phone is 281-693-7427. <br>
&gt; Cell phone is 713-304-9353 (where you can reach me most of the <br>
&gt; time...picking up and dropping off one of my many children).  Everyone <br>
&gt; is doing great...growing up too fast. <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Talk to you soon, <br>
&gt; Judy <br>

Subject: Succession Plan<br>
<br>
It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my <br>
recommendation to appoint Jeff Skilling as chief executive officer, effective <br>
at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will also <br>
retain his duties as president and chief operating officer.  I will continue <br>
as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the <br>
strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.<br>
<br>
Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all <br>
cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for <br>
the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I,m ready for a <br>
somewhat different role.<br>
<br>
Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff and <br>
me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that <br>
continues to exceed everyone,s expectations, including our own.  We look <br>
forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.<br>
<br>
There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad <br>
shifts in strategy and direction.<br>
<br>
Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.<br>
<br>

<br>
Could you please send the service agreement into Koch for the Ormet <br>
transaction.  This memo that I wrote to Scott details the rates that we have <br>
negotiated with Koch.  Koch has to post our deal for five days, so could you <br>
please try to send it out today if at all possible.  I am also sending you <br>
the draft letter agreement that Koch sent to us which we will also need to <br>
execute.  We will also need to put an IT agreement in place with Koch.  They <br>
have offered the same discounted rates on an IT basis for any volumes above <br>
the 15,000/d of FT.<br>
<br>
Also, could you please arrange to put in place an IT agreement on Cypress for <br>
delivery to Ormet Aluminum's Burnside,LA<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help.<br>
<br>

Ormet's Burnside,LA Aluminum refinery is dually connected to Koch and Cypress.<br>
The transport rates that  Koch has quoted for FT to Ormet are as follows:<br>
<br>
From Bridgeline/Paradis or LRC/ Paradis .03 demand charge<br>
<br>
from Venice     .05 demand charge<br>
<br>
from the Mobile Bay pooling point on Koch .045 demand charge<br>
(if we buy upstream of the pooling point then we would also pay a .0246 <br>
gathering fee on Mobile Bay)<br>
<br>
In addition we will be charged .0022 ACA from any of these receipt points.<br>
<br>
The fuel rate is 1.6%.  This will be passed on to Ormet.<br>
<br>
Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the <br>
same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis.  If this IT is cut, we <br>
still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch or <br>
on Cypress.  Ormet pays all additional transport costs.<br>
Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly <br>
balancing at any point during the contract term.<br>
I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event <br>
that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need the <br>
gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress).  If you have any preferences <br>
for alternate delivery points, please let me know.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned, we  have already quoted NYMEX + .055 as the all-in delivered <br>
price to Ormet.<br>
<br>
Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is <br>
due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow).  They are one <br>
hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thank you for all of your help on this deal.<br>

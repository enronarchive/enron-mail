Weather forecasts would indicate low demand conditions through the<br>
Thanksgiving Holiday's.  TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE) is facing high<br>
line pack levels and full storage.  Thus the pipe has severely<br>
restricted ability to absorb due-shipper gas.  Effective immediately,<br>
and continuing through the end of the month, TE is requiring that:<br>
     -    All shippers ensure their physical receipts do not exceed  physical<br>
       deliveries.<br>
     -    Receipt operators are expected to not flow above scheduled volumes.<br>
     -    Delivery meters are expected to take all gas scheduled.<br>
     -    Any customer who is long should take immediate action to resolve<br>
       due-shipper positions.<br>
<br>
No due-pipeline makeup gas may be scheduled. OBA parties should ensure<br>
that physical takes match scheduled nominations. Due-shipper makeup gas<br>
may be scheduled through your Operations Account Manager.  These<br>
restrictions are expected to be in effect until further notice.<br>
<br>
Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any<br>
questions.<br>

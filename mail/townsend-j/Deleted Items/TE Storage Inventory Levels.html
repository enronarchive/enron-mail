On  November 15, 2001, Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (&quot;Texas  Eastern&quot;)<br>
notified firm storage customers that, as required by the Federal  Energy<br>
Regulatory Commission's November 30, 1994 order, in Docket No.  RP95-15,<br>
Texas  Eastern would monitor customer storage activity and  would  issue<br>
customer-specific Operational Flow Orders (&quot;OFOs&quot;) prior to the issuance<br>
of a system-wide storage OFO pursuant to Section 4.3  (L) of the General<br>
Terms  and Conditions of Texas Eastern's  FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised<br>
Volume No. 1    (&quot;Tariff&quot;).<br>
<br>
As indicated in Texas Eastern's November 15, 2001 letter, the need for a<br>
customer  specific  OFO  would be determined based  on  such  customer's<br>
variance  from  the suggested storage withdrawal plan specified  in  the<br>
November  15, 2001 mailing.  The Withdrawal Plan indicates  the  maximum<br>
recommended storage withdrawals for each of four (4) withdrawal  periods<br>
and  is  designed to reflect in the aggregate Texas Eastern's historical<br>
utilization of its storage facilities prior to the implementation of the<br>
Commission's Order No. 636<br>
<br>
Texas Eastern is not issuing a Customer-Specific OFO at this time due to<br>
the  high  aggregate storage position at 12/31/2001. Texas Eastern  will<br>
continue to monitor individual customer storage activity and may need to<br>
issue  customer-specific  OFOs  if  required  by  future  circumstances.<br>
Customer-specific OFOs will be based upon each customer's variance  from<br>
the suggested storage withdrawal plan provided to you and the other firm<br>
storage customers by letter dated November 15, 2001.<br>
<br>
If  you  have  any  questions  regarding the foregoing  matters,  please<br>
contact your Account Manager.<br>

<br>
Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.<br>
<br>
Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 <br>
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:<br>
	<br>
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am<br>
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm<br>
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm<br>
	3:30 pm --   4:30 pm<br>
<br>
No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.<br>
<br>

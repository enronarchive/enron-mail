<br>
Effective immediately, based on anticipated system operations and<br>
weather conditions, as stated below, ALGONQUIN GAS TRANSMISSION (AGT) is<br>
requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt steps to<br>
eliminate excess receipts and to conform scheduled receipts to actual<br>
deliveries.<br>
<br>
Weather continues to be unseasonably mild and shippers have been<br>
scheduling gas in excess of actual takes. As a result, there is no line<br>
pack available for system operational purposes and AGT cannot continue<br>
to absorb actual imbalances left on the system.<br>
<br>
AGT will continue to closely monitor current pipeline conditions.  To<br>
the extent necessary, AGT will contact customers on an individual basis<br>
regarding additional action by AGT to protect system operations. AGT<br>
recommends that all customers rank both their supplies and their markets<br>
in the event that system-wide reductions are required.  To the extent<br>
AGT and customers are unable to agree upon appropriate action within a<br>
reasonable time, AGT may adjust customer's nominations ï¿½and revise<br>
scheduled quantitiesÃ™ immediately to halt the further accumulation of<br>
imbalances. In addition, AGT may take any actions within its operational<br>
capabilities to reduce excess receipts.<br>
<br>
No due pipe imbalance makeup will be accepted until further notice.<br>
<br>
Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any<br>
questions.<br>

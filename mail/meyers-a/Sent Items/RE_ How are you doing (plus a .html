Hi Bertmeister!<br>
Good to have you back in the UBS fold. It is also good to hear all is going<br>
well for you and Molly. I would look forward to getting together sometime,<br>
perhaps for breakfast next Tuesday or Wednesday (2/5 or 2/6). Let me know<br>
which works for you.<br>
<br>
Tom<br>

Just wanted to drop you a line to let you know that I am again an employee<br>
of UBS.  As I am sure you are aware, we are in process of transition from<br>
Enron to UBS.  I recently filled out all the appropriate paperwork to<br>
complete the transition.  From what I understand we are going to be a part<br>
of the trading arm of UBS Warbug.  This should be very exciting.  Maybe one<br>
day I will have the opportunity to trade stocks, bonds, or some other<br>
financial product if power ever becomes old hat.  <br>
<br>
Furthermore, I have will soon receive a signing bonus and a raise, so I<br>
intend on funding my IRA and my wife's IRA for 2001 and maybe even 2002.  If<br>
it wouldn't be too much trouble, I would like to know what the contribution<br>
levels are for 2002.  I think I saw something that changed them and the<br>
income levels one can have for a Roth.<br>
<br>
As for Molly, the advertising business seems to be picking up for 2002.  She<br>
opened enough new business in the fourth quarter of 2001 to meet her goals<br>
and is on her way to making it the first quarter as well.  I think she is<br>
really beginning to understand her business.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I currently have lots of time to myself since we are not trading, so<br>
maybe we can have lunch sometime.  If that is not possible, no big deal, I<br>
know that you are extremely busy.<br>
<br>
I hope all is well with you and your family.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Bert<br>

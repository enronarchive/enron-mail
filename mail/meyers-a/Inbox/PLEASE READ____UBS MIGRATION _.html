This message is only relevant for those going to UBS.<br>
...<br>
<br>
It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.<br>
<br>
This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  <br>
<br>
H Drives:<br>
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  <br>
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.<br>
<br>
O Drives:<br>
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M â€¦ pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.<br>
<br>
Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.  <br>

Friends and Co-Workers:<br>
<br>
You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.<br>
<br>
LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter &quot;we&quot; or &quot;our&quot; or &quot;us&quot; ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily, be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by joining us in the meal (&quot;Lunch&quot;) you will not be exposed to any retroactive claw-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beverage (&quot;Beer&quot;) under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Board which is being sought on an expedited basis.       <br>
<br>
We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: <br>
<br>
1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.<br>
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.<br>
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.<br>
<br>
We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.<br>
<br>
Christian and Steve      <br>
<br>

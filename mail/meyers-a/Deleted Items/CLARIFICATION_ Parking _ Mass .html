Hello all!<br>
<br>
We thought we would clarify the Parking &amp; Mass Transit options:<br>
<br>
1) Three options are available:<br>
<br>
2WTC/Outside parking lots<br>
- Those who park at 2WTC will continue to be set up with monthly parking deductions<br>
- Those who park in outside lots pay out-of-pocket and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month<br>
<br>
Tri-Met<br>
- No out-of-pocket expense or paycheck deduction.<br>
<br>
Daily Validations<br>
- Employees may park at any location and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month.<br>
<br>
2) You may choose only ONE of these available options.<br>
- If you selected the mass transit option, you must pay out-of-pocket (with no reimbursement) for parking fees incurred on days you choose to drive into the office.<br>
<br>
3) If you would like to change your parking/mass transit option, please contact Grace or Julie.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, please let us know.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
Your HR Team<br>

Subject:	Parking &amp; Mass Transit Resolution<br>
<br>
We have reached resolution regarding the parking and mass transit issue.  Until notified otherwise, the parking and mass transit subsidy will continue as an employee benefit. <br>
<br>
For those who have a payroll parking deduction, your deduction has been stopped.  No deduction should occur on 12/31/01 payroll.  In addition, you should receive a credit for the deduction taken for the 12/15 payroll.  <br>
<br>
For those who incurred any out-of-pocket parking costs during the month of December, you may expense up to $89 for reimbursement.  <br>
<br>
Beginning 1/1/02, parking and mass transit will continue as follows:<br>
<br>
WTC Parking:  You should receive your parking pass in the mail. Payroll deductions will begin on the 1/15/02 paycheck. (No Action Req'd)<br>
<br>
Outside Parking Lots:  Park at lot of your choice and pay out of pocket.  Request reimbursement of up to $89 per month. (No payroll parking deduction will occur)<br>
<br>
Tri-Met and MAX employees:  Passes are available for January.  If you would like to pick up your pass, please see Debra Davidson.   <br>
<br>
NOTE:  Extra Tri-Met passes are available.  If you would like to select mass transit as your parking option, please notify either Grace or myself before Friday, 12/21/01 EOB and we will insure a monthly pass is available.<br>
<br>
Validations:  We will no longer validate parking passes, however, you are able to reimburse up to $89 per month for daily parking.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, please let us know!<br>

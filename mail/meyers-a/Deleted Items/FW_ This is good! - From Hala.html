How to Explain Enron to Your Children:<br>
<br>
Feudalism - You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.<br>
Fascism - You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to<br>
take care of them, and sells you the<br>
milk.<br>
Communism - You have two cows. Your neighbors help take care of them and<br>
you share the milk.<br>
Totalitarianism - You have two cows. The government takes them both and<br>
denies they ever existed and drafts<br>
you into the army. Milk is banned.<br>
Capitalism - You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd<br>
multiplies, and the economy grows. You<br>
sell them and retire on the income.<br>
Enron Venture Capitalism - You have two cows. You sell three of them to<br>
your publicly listed company, using<br>
letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then<br>
execute a debt/equity swap with an associated<br>
general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption<br>
for five cows. The milk rights of the six<br>
cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company<br>
secretly owned by the majority<br>
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed<br>
company. The annual report says the<br>
company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.<br>

Have a good weekend!<br>

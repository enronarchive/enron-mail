Bert,<br>
I'll see you there. If you would rather meet downtown, we can meet at Leo's<br>
on 11th and Taylor behind the Library. What works for you?<br>

Earlier I wrote that it would be easier for me to meet downtown because I<br>
don't have my car.  However, Molly has made an unexpected trip to PA so I<br>
have her car.  Meeting @ the Buffalo Gap is not a problem anymore.<br>

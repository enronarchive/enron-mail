Hey Bert,<br>
<br>
I'm sure you knew that the Clintons were total dirtbags, but Hillary may have hit a new low.  Apparently, Hillary said that Chelsea was endangered by the attack.  But Chelsea gave a contradictory interview, saying that she watched the attack from a friend's apartment.<br>
<br>
Later,<br>

Though, as usual, the elite media ignores it, some (Drudge, Wash Times, NY Post, Fox) are highlighting the contradiction in stories between Hillary and Chelsea as to Chelsea's 9/11 experience. Just after 9/11, Hillary told Jane Pauley that Chelsea &quot;had gone on what she thought would be a great jog. She was going down to the Battery Park; she was going to go around the towers. She went to get a cup of coffee and - that's when the plane hit.&quot; Hillary said Chelsea heard the plane hit the WTC and saw the smoke in person. However, Chelsea penned a piece for Talk magazine that stated, &quot;On the morning it happened I was at my friend Nicole Davison's apartment, near Union Square in Manhattan. That morning we had gotten up and grabbed coffee, and then she took the subway to work while I bought a paper and headed back to her apartment. I had just walked in when she called from work. A plane had just crashed into the World Trade Center, she said. I should stay put and she'd call me back when she knew more. I turned on the television and watched as the second plane hit.&quot; Chelsea writes she &quot;spent the nightmarish day of the Twin Towers attacks in complete mental chaos -- roaming the city, obsessing over&quot; W's tax cut while singing Humpty Dumpty to herself. Where did she learn how to personalize national tragedy and inject partisan politics at the same time? <br>

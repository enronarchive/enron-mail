   Despite the 11th-hour clamoring of industry and consumer groups,<br>
   Portland General Electric's 30 to 50 percent rate increases took effect<br>
   today.<br>
<br>
   Last Monday, Associated Oregon Industries, Industrial Customers of<br>
   Northwest Utilities and the Citizen's Utility Board collectively<br>
   petitioned the Oregon Public Utility Commission to delay and reconsider<br>
   the rate increases. The groups said the increases amount to &quot;rate shock&quot;<br>
   and would further debilitate an ailing Northwest economy.<br>
<br>
   OPUC decided Friday to deny the delay request. However, the commission<br>
   did agree to review the reconsideration request in an expedited process<br>
   that could take fewer than 30 days.<br>
<br>
   &quot;The commission, in denying the stay petition, concluded the petitioners<br>
   failed to show irreparable harm, and a colorable claim of error in the<br>
   order,&quot; stated an OPUC press release.<br>
<br>
   PGE has said the increases reflect a leap in wholesale costs it pays to<br>
   buy power on the open market. The utility is offering free &quot;audits&quot; to<br>
   help businesses find ways to conserve power.<br>
<br>
   One key backer of the petition is Intel Corp., which told &quot;The Business<br>
   Journal&quot; last week that its own 50 percent rate increase &quot;makes Oregon<br>
   much less competitive to do business, and that gets factored into future<br>
   investment decisions.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Also last week, OPUC approved requests from the state's three natural<br>
   gas distributors--Northwest Natural, Cascade and Avista--to increase<br>
   prices today. Rates for Northwest Natural's commercial and industrial<br>
   customers are increasing by 23 to 28 percent. Similar customers of<br>
   Cascade will see increases of around 8 percent.<br>

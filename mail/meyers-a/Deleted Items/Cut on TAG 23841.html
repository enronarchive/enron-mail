To Whom it may concern:<br>
<br>
Tag 23841 was cut by 50 MW for HE 01 and HE 02.  Wally @ NEVP said he heard of the cut @ 23:30 on 06/27/01 but he neglected to call us and tell us about the cut.  The reason for the cut was PAC non-firm tranny being cut that PSCO bought.  However they sold us a firm product.  PNM didn't know about the cut either until their reliability person told them they were pushing power on the grid (Approx. time of notification 01:20).  We booked out with PSCO and PNM for HE 01 and HE 02 on the 4C345 part of the transaction (deals 666385 and 666387).  For HE 03 25 MW was cut and we booked out with PSCO and PNM on the 4C345 piece of the transaction (deals 666385 and 666387).  PSCO resupplied the power for HE 03 from SRP @ Mead 230.   The same thing happened for HE 06 as HE 03.  SRP resupplied  the power for HE 06.  I bought back for HE 06 from PSCO @ 4C345 and resold the power to SRP.  The deals are in the RT Inc. sheet for the 28th of June.  After the fact, I spoke with Ryan @ PSCO and he agreed to be billed liquidated damages for HE 01 and HE 02 on the MEAD 230 part of the transaction (06:00 on Kate Symes Phone).<br>

To whom it may concern:<br>
<br>
Tags numbered 33079 (5mw) and 33086 (20mw) were cut for a number of hours.  <br>
<br>
HE 08 and HE 09:<br>
Both tags were cut and nobody informed any of the counter parties that the tags were cut until about 25minutes into the last hour of the cuts.  I initially heard of the cuts from Larry @ MEANMN and immediately called each person in the path to inform them of the cut situation.  No action was taken for these two hours.<br>
<br>
HE 13:<br>
Both tags were cut and we purchased 25mw from APS to cover the cut and had it delivered to four corners 345 @ a price of $25.00.<br>
<br>
HE 17:<br>
Both tags were cut and we purchased 25mw from LADWP to cover the cut and had it delivered to Palo Verde @ a price of $44.00.  Will @ PNM agreed to having the power delivered @ a different location.<br>
<br>
HE 18 and HE 19:<br>
Both tags were cut and we purchased 25mw from SRP to cover the cut and had it delivered to four corners 345 @ a price of $45.00.<br>
<br>
HE 20:<br>
Tag 33086 was cut to 0 (total of 20mw) steve merriss bought power from El Paso for $45.00.<br>
<br>
Steve Merriss input the cut note into the lotus database.<br>

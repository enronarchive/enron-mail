Group,<br>

Cuts are on the way. While most can be zeroed out in Enpower (for LD's) like normal, longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day. In the interest of being uniform, the guidelines for cuts are below. <br>
<br>
We will be handling cuts in the following manner:<br>
<br>
1. Documentation is priority #1. We need to fill out a cut sheet with the times, the name of the person who called, the tag number, the quantity and price.<br>
<br>
2. After attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace.<br>
<br>
3. We need to zero out all cut deals in Enpower, we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity. The annuity must be made HE 1 on the following day of the schedule. The annuity needs to be for 1 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract. In the comment section of the annuity you must include the Enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example (4 hours @ 25 mws X $100 per mw = $10,000).<br>
<br>
4. Please be as accurate as possible. We still need to be flat in Enpower at the end of each day. And we still need to calculate our daily position.<br>
<br>
5. Put all cut sheets in the accordion folder on Kate Symes' Desk.<br>
<br>
I appreciate your help and diligence.<br>
Thanks,<br>

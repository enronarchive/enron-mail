Hey sorry about that phone call last night, I didnt realize that Leaf was going to get on the phone ant try to reorganize his whole schedule. Anyway, I wanted to let you know that when the schedule came out I did already make plans to go away for the 24th-27th and the 30th -Jan 2nd in order to get cheap flights.  And as far as the day shifts go you can give me as much damn vacation as you want being that I have 3 weeks of unused vacation that will expire and I dont think there will be much opportunity to learn shit around here in the current environment.  Well anyway good luck trying to make that schedule work and hopefully we will have jobs to come to in December. Thanks again dude!  Oh hey call me if you want to grab a beer Thursday or Friday night. <br>

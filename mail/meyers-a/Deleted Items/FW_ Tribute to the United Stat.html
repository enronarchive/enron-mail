This is so uplifting and appropriate for today, even though it was originally broadcast by Gordon Sinclair (a Canadian radio broadcaster) nearly 30 years ago (1973)!<br>

 <br>
 &gt;TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The Americans <br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;&quot;This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most<br>
&gt;generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.<br>
&gt;Germany,<br>
&gt;Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the<br>
&gt;debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and<br>
&gt;forgave<br>
&gt;other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying even the<br>
&gt;interest on its remaining debts to the United States.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who<br>
&gt;propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the<br>
&gt;streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries<br>
&gt;in to help. This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes.<br>
&gt;Nobody helped.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into<br>
&gt;discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about<br>
&gt;the decadent, warmongering Americans. I'd like to see just one of those<br>
&gt;countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar<br>
&gt;build<br>
&gt;its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have a plane to<br>
&gt;equal<br>
&gt;the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so,<br>
&gt;why<br>
&gt;don't they fly them? Why do all the International lines except Russia fly<br>
&gt;American Planes? Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a<br>
&gt;man<br>
&gt;or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get<br>
&gt;radios. You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles. You<br>
&gt;talk<br>
&gt;about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon -not once, but<br>
&gt;several times and safely home again.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store<br>
&gt;window for everybody to look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued<br>
&gt;and<br>
&gt;hounded. They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are<br>
&gt;breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at<br>
&gt;home<br>
&gt;to spend here.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through<br>
&gt;age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad<br>
&gt;and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose.<br>
&gt;Both<br>
&gt;are still broke.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other<br>
&gt;people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced<br>
&gt;to<br>
&gt;the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during<br>
&gt;the San Francisco earthquake.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned<br>
&gt;tired<br>
&gt;of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with<br>
&gt;their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose<br>
&gt;at<br>
&gt;the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is<br>
&gt;not<br>
&gt;one of those.&quot;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Stand proud, America!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;This is one of the best editorials that I have ever<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;read regarding the United States. It is nice that one<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;man realizes it. I only wish that the rest of the<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;world would realize it. We are always blamed for<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;everything, and never even get a thank you for the<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;things we do.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Maybe each of you can send this to at least one person<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;and they might send it to one of their friends until this letter<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;is sent to every person on the web.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I am just a single<br>
&gt;American that has read this,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;I SURE HOPE THAT A LOT MORE READ IT SOON.<br>

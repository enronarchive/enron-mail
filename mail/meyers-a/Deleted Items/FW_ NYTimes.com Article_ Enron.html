Enron Seeks Quick Auction of Trading Unit<br>
<br>
December 17, 2001 <br>
<br>
By JONATHAN D. GLATER<br>

<br>
The Enron Corporation (news/quote) has found at least 14<br>
potential buyers interested in its energy trading business,<br>
enough so that it plans to go ahead with an auction for the<br>
unit in less than a month without lining up a fallback<br>
buyer first. <br>
<br>
In papers filed with a bankruptcy court in New York late<br>
Friday afternoon, lawyers for Enron, which sought Chapter<br>
11 protection earlier this month, asked Judge Arthur J.<br>
Gonzalez to approve an auction of a 51 percent stake in a<br>
joint venture. That venture would own Enron's wholesale<br>
energy business, which includes Enron Online and which<br>
trades commodities ranging from natural gas to steel in<br>
addition to complex financial instruments. <br>
<br>
Lawyers involved in the bankruptcy proceedings said the<br>
company and its lawyers had decided to proceed with an<br>
auction as quickly as possible to prevent further<br>
deterioration of the trading operation's value. The<br>
decision means that Enron, which is based in Houston, has<br>
dropped plans to negotiate a deal with one buyer - J. P.<br>
Morgan Chase (news/quote) and UBS Warburg have both been<br>
mentioned for the role of &quot;stalking horse&quot; - against which<br>
other bidders would compete. <br>
<br>
&quot;There are 14 interested parties,&quot; said Martin J.<br>
Bienenstock, whose law firm, Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges, is<br>
representing Enron. &quot;Some of them would like to be stalking<br>
horses, but we don't really need one.&quot; <br>
<br>
Mr. Bienenstock did not provide any guidance on what an<br>
investor might be expected to pay. &quot;We're not selling it<br>
for dollars,&quot; he said. &quot;We're creating a joint venture.<br>
We're putting in the traders, the systems and the<br>
intellectual property; the other party is putting in<br>
creditworthiness. The issue in the auction is what part of<br>
the joint venture will Enron own and what part the other&quot;<br>
company will own. The 49 percent-51 percent split may not<br>
be the final ownership structure, he added. <br>
<br>
A hearing will be held on Wednesday on an Enron motion that<br>
lays out bidding procedures, and Enron proposed that the<br>
auction be conducted on Jan. 10. <br>
<br>
One lawyer involved in the proceedings said that &quot;more<br>
typically, you would go in there with a negotiated deal&quot;<br>
that the bankruptcy court could use as a benchmark for<br>
evaluating competing bids. But producing a negotiated deal<br>
takes time, this lawyer said, and Enron is trying to<br>
complete this sale &quot;extremely fast.&quot; He added, &quot;Whether<br>
that's realistic, I don't know.&quot; <br>
<br>
Bankers and lawyers for Enron have said that if the trading<br>
business is to be sold as a going concern, it will have to<br>
be sold quickly. &quot;Each day that the wholesale business is<br>
not acting at full capacity is another day for a competitor<br>
to lure customers&quot; or employees, Enron's lawyers warned in<br>
the filing on Friday. <br>
<br>
It is also important that the trading business find a<br>
creditworthy partner to maintain the confidence of clients.<br>
Otherwise, buyers of energy or other commodities, fearing<br>
that transactions might not be completed because of lack of<br>
financial strength, would not do business with the joint<br>
venture. <br>
<br>
For these reasons, an auction was expected, especially<br>
after Enron told creditors last week that it planned to<br>
create a joint venture with a creditworthy financial<br>
institution to take over the trading business. <br>
<br>
Auctions are used in bankruptcy proceedings to ensure that<br>
the bankrupt company receives the maximum amount from sales<br>
of its assets. The proceeds, which in this case would<br>
probably come in the form of future dividend payments or<br>
profits from the sale of Enron's share of the joint<br>
venture, would then be used to help pay off creditors,<br>
lawyers said. <br>

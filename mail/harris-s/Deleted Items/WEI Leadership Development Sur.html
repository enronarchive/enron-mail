Dear Steve<br>
<br>
We need your feedback to better define leadership development for WEI.<br>
<br>
As you may be aware the WEI Board has approved recommendations on how WEI<br>
should evaluate our activities and then recognize the many people who<br>
contribute to their design, development and delivery.  We will clearly<br>
standardize how we evaluate &quot;what&quot; WEI does.  However, due to the very<br>
different approaches used in the past to develop programs and people, the<br>
Committee sees a strong to need clarify what members desire when it comes to<br>
industry specific leadership development.<br>
<br>
Following are a list of possible components of a WEI Industry Specific<br>
Leadership Development program.  Will you please take a few minutes to rate<br>

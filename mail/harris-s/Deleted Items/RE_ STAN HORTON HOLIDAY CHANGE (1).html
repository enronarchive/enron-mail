Hello, everyone!   <br>
<br>
It has been determined that Stan will NOT be in the office on Monday, December 31; therefore, we will NOT have an ETS staff meeting that day.   Please notify any of your people who customarily attend and who I may have inadvertently left off the above distribution.   Stan did ask that his direct reports send him via e-mail a weekly update of key points for the week of December 23 and the week of December 30.<br>
<br>
Stan wanted you to know that he will back in the office next Thursday, December 27, for meetings or conference calls and even on the 28th, if necessary.   So don't hesitate to call me should you need to schedule some time with Stan.   I will be here!<br>
<br>

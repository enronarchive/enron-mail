I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish strong<br>
this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing sales<br>
by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to help me<br>
do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by giving<br>
me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be interested<br>
in the type of service we offer.<br>
<br>
Some things to consider:<br>
<br>
We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.<br>
We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.<br>
<br>
If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have an<br>
interest as well.<br>
<br>
Some memory joggers:<br>
<br>
Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?<br>
Who do you know that likes nice cars?<br>
Who do you know that owns their own company?<br>
Who do you know that is successful in sales?<br>
Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?<br>
Who do you know that owns their own airplane?<br>
Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical clothing?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help!<br>

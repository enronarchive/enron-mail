That sounds great. I would like to spend as much time with you as possible so come as early as you can and stay as late as you want. <br>
<br>
I actually thought the movie was pretty good. We'll see what we can come up with the next time. <br>
<br>
I'll try not to eat too much this week ( I have to look good for you!).<br>
<br>
Take care.<br>
<br>

Hey Steve- Since the 6th looks like it is a good day to get together, maybe I could come over to your house around 12:00.   We could go to lunch, and since I had the the last priviledge of  picking out a &quot;very interesting movie&quot;, I would like you to to pick out the next one! This time I also have a lot more time flexibility in the afternoon.<br>
     Of course, I will drop you a quick line prior to the 6th to make sure your schedule is still on target.  Otherwise, enjoy Thanksgiving with your family (don't get too fat!).  Talk with you later.  Christine<br>

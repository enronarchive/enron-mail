Steve,<br>
 <br>
Attached is a list of about 350 power plants scattered across the western  states.  This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?<br>
 <br>
If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.<br>
 <br>
This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.  <br>
 <br>
By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.   <br>
 <br>
By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.<br>
 <br>
We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.<br>
 <br>
Thanks for your help.  <br>
 <br>

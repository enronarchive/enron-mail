Mr. Steve Harris<br>
Regional Vice President<br>
Transwestern Pipeline Company<br>
<br>
Dear Mr. Harris:<br>
<br>
Recently, there has been a lot of discussion and confusion on the<br>
direction of the distributed energy (DE) industry. With the summer stock<br>
price collapse and slow market development, many DE stakeholders are<br>
re-thinking their strategies. Cambridge Energy Research Associates<br>
(CERA) is as well.<br>
<br>
In an effort to provide you with the most up-to-date, valued<br>
information, CERA is asking each member of our Distributed Energy<br>
Advisory Service to complete a brief survey so that we may better serve<br>
you.  The survey can be found at the following link:<br>
http://www.cera.com/survey/distributed<br>
<br>
This survey is anonymous and all comments are welcome. We plan to<br>
present and discuss the results at our Executive Retreat in Santa Fe,<br>
New Mexico, December 5-7, 2001.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and we appreciate your input.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Steven Taub<br>
Director, Distributed Energy<br>
<br>
<br>

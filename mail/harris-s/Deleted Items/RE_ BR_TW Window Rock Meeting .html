Subject: BR/TW Window Rock Meeting Scheduled for Dec 3rd<br>
<br>
<br>
Michelle, <br>
	We are looking forward to the planned meeting between BR and TW to further discuss the Window Rock interconnect.  The following is<br>
an informal agenda listing of topics:<br>
<br>
1.  BR would provide an overview of our November 6th discussions with EPNG regarding the Window Rock Interconnect.  <br>
<br>
2.   As discussed, it would be beneficial if TW would be able to discuss the operating parameters along TW's pipeline system prior to and<br>
after the proposed Red Rock expansion.  In particular, BR would be interested in expected pressures/volumes at Window Rock, Station 4, 5 and<br>
Thoreau prior to the expansion and after the expansion with 0mmcf/d, 50 mmcf/d, 100mmcf/d, and 150mmcf/d delivered at Window Rock into TW.<br>
The Window Rock deliveries into TW would physically service markets to the west while allowing TW to reduce physical flow from the eastern<br>
delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to BR.  <br>
<br>
3.  Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries. <br>
<br>
4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service. <br>
<br>
5.  Discuss potential meeting between TW/EPNG/BR    <br>
	  <br>
Please give me a call if you would like to discuss the above prior to the meeting or if you would like to add additional topics.  We look<br>
forward to meeting with you Monday, Dec 3rd in our office at 3pm.  Thanks, <br>
<br>

Dear Mexico Gas and Power Client,<br>
<br>
As you might be aware, Pemex is proposing a new type of service contract as a<br>
way to increase E&amp;P investment in nonassociated gas in the Burgos basin.<br>
Originally, CERA was planning to have a luncheon in December to discuss the<br>
current status of these integrated contracts. Our intention was to invite key<br>
individuals from Pemex to discuss the proposed contracts with our clients.<br>
Pemex has informed us, however, that they are unable to discuss the service<br>
contracts with the private sector prior to their formal announcement of the<br>
service contract structure. Until this constraint has been resolved, CERA has<br>
decided to have a conference call detailed below. We look forward to your<br>
participation.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
<br>
Mexico Gas and Power<br>

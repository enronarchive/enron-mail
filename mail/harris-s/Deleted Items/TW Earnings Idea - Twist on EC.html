Hello Steve -<br>
<br>
Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update - I<br>
moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago and<br>
have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management &amp; Pipeline Optimization<br>
projects.<br>
<br>
I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture has a<br>
strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered<br>
Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology &amp; technology for<br>
making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&amp;D<br>
companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.  This<br>
is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:<br>
<br>
<br>
1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM<br>
2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)<br>
3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from RCM<br>
(say $20MM) as part of our &quot;guarantee&quot;<br>
4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over the<br>
next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.<br>
<br>
I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am around the<br>
Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to discuss<br>
further.<br>
<br>
Hope all is well.<br>
<br>

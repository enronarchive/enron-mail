Remember to join Enron Global Services Chairman &amp; CEO Stan Horton on an eSpeak session Thursday, October 18 at 10 a.m. Houston time where he will answer questions regarding the new EGS. This is a great opportunity to get first hand information about what's going on within EGS and throughout Enron. <br>
<br>
If you can't make the live event, don't sweat it.  Go to http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp, and submit your question(s) today.  Stan will try to answer your questions during his &quot;open mike&quot; session, and you can read the transcript whenever you get the opportunity. <br>
<br>
Don't miss this opportunity to hear it straight from the top.<br>

Title: Hidden Risks: Microbasis in the Short-term Gas Markets<br>

STRUCTURAL RISK AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY GROW IN INFLUENCE IN REGIONAL GAS<br>
MARKETS.<br>
<br>
The dramatic increase of participants in the daily market for natural gas over<br>
the past several years has brought with it the demand for pricing indices that<br>
are increasingly regional and selective in nature. These published indices<br>
provide a valuable service to the market, but the high level of confidence that<br>
the general trading community has bestowed upon them may be misplaced.<br>
<br>
*  Current economic conditions are masking hidden volatility potential,<br>
especially at local index points that have unrealized demand potential.<br>
<br>
*  Large, volatile demand in the form of new gas-fired generation utilizes the<br>
existing pipeline system in ways that were never envisioned in the original<br>
system design.<br>
<br>
*  Control of pipeline infrastructure has moved from the relatively benign<br>
local distribution companies to economically driven traders and asset managers.<br>
<br>
*  As demand grows, physical flexibility in the system and the number of buyers<br>
and sellers decrease on the margin.<br>

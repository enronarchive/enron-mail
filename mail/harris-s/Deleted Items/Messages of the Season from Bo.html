<br>
Throughout this holiday season we have been reminded by press and media of<br>
the changes to our lives' normality because of the events these last few<br>
months.  When we travel we observe uniformed soldiers and added security<br>
that tell us our way of living and business conduct has forever changed.<br>
<br>
The messages of this holiday season, Hope, Peace, Love and Joy have<br>
significant meaning.  All our hearts desire these feelings to endure.<br>
Perhaps like never before we should commit to be instruments that bring<br>
Hope, Peace, Love and Joy to our country and to our world.  Our faith in<br>
those principles and ideas that have carried us and made us great has been<br>
renewed.  Our resolve to make a difference in every endeavor has been<br>
strengthened.  We know we will get better after being in the valley of<br>
adversity and trial.<br>
<br>
Tom James Company and all our employees across the United States, the United<br>
Kingdom, Japan and Holland join me in thanking you for your business in<br>
2001.  We have been tested and we are strengthened.  Our partners, who call<br>
on you, are better equipped entering 2002 than ever before to serve you.  We<br>
have significantly added quality products in all our price points and<br>
expanded our casual wear.  The addition in 2001 of the finest footwear made<br>
in the world has given us the highest quality footwear product available.<br>
<br>
Our partners in our 11 factories have been touched by the events of<br>
September 11th and after.  Most of our manufacturing facilities are in the<br>
Northeast part of the United States.  Tom James, like so many others,<br>
experienced loss.  So, going forward forever in our memories will be the<br>
faces and pictures of 2001.<br>
<br>
Our commitment to you is to be better and our obligation to life is to give<br>
back to life with what we are and who we become.  Your patronage is very<br>
important to Tom James.  Please let us know when we do not perform to your<br>
expectation.  Our guarantee is 100% satisfaction.  We live by our creed.<br>
<br>
Thank you for helping us enjoy a fine year.  We will pursue excellence in<br>
serving you, our valued client.  Best wishes for your continued health,<br>
happiness and prosperity in the New Year.<br>
<br>
Happy Holidays!<br>
Respect and Regards<br>
Robert F. Sherrer<br>
Chairman and President, Tom James Company<br>

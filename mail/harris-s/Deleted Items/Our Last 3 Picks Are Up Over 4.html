OTCBB Stock Alert's Last Two Picks:<br>
<br>
CPTH from $ .55 to $3.05 for a GAIN OF OVER 400%!<br>
NVTL from $ .31 to $1.24 for a GAIN OF OVER 300%!<br>
<br>
HERE IS OUR NEXT EXPLOSIVE STOCK PICK:<br>
Royal Finance, Inc. (OTCBB: ROYA)<br>
BUY AT $1.25<br>
SELL TARGET $5.25 = DIAMOND PLAY !<br>
<br>
MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER<br>
COVERAGE FOR ROYA !<br>
<br>
Revenues for ROYA, a fully-reporting, multi-faceted<br>
financial services firm, have skyrocketed 500% higher<br>
this year due to 10 Federal Reserve interest rate cuts,<br>
placing rates at their lowest levels in over 4 decades.<br>
<br>
ROYA is experiencing record breaking loan volume, real<br>
estate sales, and mortgage refinancing as the rush is<br>
on with rates having dropped to bargain basement levels.<br>
<br>
We are expecting significant news regarding increasing<br>
revenue and significant aquisitions, enhancing<br>
the bottom line for rapid revenue growth.  The stock has<br>
already bounced sharply from its 52-week low and will<br>
continue moving up immediately. We think the stock could<br>
easily climb above $5 in less than a month.<br>
<br>
WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION<br>
AS ROYA MAY VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE MOST UNDERVALUED<br>
STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!<br>

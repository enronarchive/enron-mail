RADICAL SHIFT IN WESTERN MARKET DYNAMICS<br>
<br>
The western power markets are entering a bust period as a result of the 24,000 <br>
megawatts of power plant additions and demand decline brought on by last year's <br>
high prices and the current economic softness. This bust period is likely to <br>
last for several years. Western gas markets have also entered a bust with the <br>
delayed start to winter and full storage inventories exerting downward pressure <br>
on both North American prices and western basis differentials. Through the <br>
remainder of this year and into well into next, western regional gas and power <br>
markets will remain soft and possibly weaken further.<br>
<br>
*  Power operating reserves should rise to above 15 percent by next summer in <br>
the Southwest and California, pushing power prices down and improving <br>
reliability.<br>
<br>
*  Power demand is expected to shrink by 11 percent in the fourth quarter; <br>
market contractions will return demand in 2002 to levels experienced in 1998. <br>
<br>
*  Full gas storage inventories, huge declines in year-over-year demand, and <br>
the onset of significant pipeline capacity additions will keep a lid on West <br>
Coast differentials.<br>

I would be happy to speak with this person. Although our experience with Mexico is limited, I can provide a briefing and offer others to speak with at Enron. <br>

Hello Drew,<br>
<br>
It was great to speak briefly with you today!<br>
<br>
The reason for my call is that I am doing research for a conference <br>
on Mexico and Latin American Gas. I was interested in speaking <br>
with you about what you think people need to know about what is <br>
going on those areas. (ie) Who are the major players, what are the <br>
major political and regulatory issues, what are some of the barriers <br>
to doing business?? I am also interested in having a speaker from <br>
Enron, and I was wondering if you might be able to give a few <br>
suggestions. I am thinking of holding the conference in early May, <br>
in Houston. Is that a good time?<br>
<br>
I look forward to your response.<br>
Thank you.<br>
Laura Watton<br>

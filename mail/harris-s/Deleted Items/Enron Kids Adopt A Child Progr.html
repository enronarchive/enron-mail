 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to &quot;sponsor&quot; every child in that school.  What we mean by &quot;sponsor&quot; is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.<br>
<br>
I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!<br>
<br>
If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to &quot;sponsor&quot; each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. <br>
<br>
All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your support!!<br>

Steve,<br>
<br>
FYI, Kirk did not have good news on the approval for Big Sandy yesterday, but it looks like they have Plan B moving forward.  I will stay in touch with Kirk and keep you posted. <br>
<br>
Thanks, Kim.<br>

Hi Kim.<br>
I trust that you are hanging in there with all of the recent activity.<br>
As for Big Sandy, the project was denied a &quot;permit&quot; yesterday by the ACC<br>
commissioners, driven principally by water issues.<br>
As for next steps, Caithness plans to submit a new filing for the same<br>
project, getting their &quot;ducks in a row&quot; on the water issues, and perhaps<br>
even conceding to the potential of dry cooling versus wet cooling.<br>
They expect to file this within the next 60 days.<br>
Thus, with a little luck, we will be back in the game on this project with<br>
an induced delay.<br>
I will keep you posted along the way....please do the same for me regarding<br>
any offerings/news/etc from your side.<br>
Thanks for all of your help so far on the project.<br>
Best regards.<br>
Kirk<br>
<br>

Hi Kirk,<br>
<br>
I just wanted to check on you and see how the approval process was<br>
going.  Have you heard from the ACC Commissioners yet?  Please let me<br>
know if we can do anything for you.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Kim.<br>

<br>
Hi Kim.<br>
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a<br>
vote<br>
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.<br>
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be<br>
approved,<br>
and may opt to resubmit.<br>
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in<br>
the<br>
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the<br>
Commissioners....major blunder.<br>
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.<br>
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect<br>
agreement,<br>
etc.<br>
Best regards,<br>
Kirk<br>
<br>

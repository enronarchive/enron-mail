Hi Pat. Yes, I would like to continue receiving the notices. Unfortunately, the next meeting conflicts with the annual Enron Management Conference (I don't recall why I could not make the last meeting but I believe I had another conflict). I found the meeting I went to very informative and therefore look forward to participating in future ones. Thanks.<br>
<br>
	Steve<br>
P.S.  <br>
<br>

Steve:  I know you got involved with the group as a speaker so let me know if you want to continue getting the meeting notices.  Since Enron is a member, you and anyone else in your group is always welcome to attend.  I'll be sure to pass on any good info I pick up as I still have some options that are now seriously out of the money.  Take care.  Pat<br>

&gt;&gt; The Pacific Northwest Gas Electric Integration Group meeting<br>
&gt;&gt; originally scheduled for September 14th, has been rescheduled for<br>
&gt;&gt; Friday, November 9, 2001. The meeting location remains the same: The<br>
&gt;&gt; Paramount Hotel in downtown Portland. The address and phone number are<br>
&gt;&gt; listed below.  My thanks again go to Calpine Corporation who will<br>
&gt;&gt; continue to serve as the host for the November meeting. Please ask for<br>
&gt;&gt; their corporate rate of $109 when making room reservations.   The<br>
&gt;&gt; meeting remains focused on new generation, with almost all the<br>
&gt;&gt; speakers still available and willing to participate. The agenda now<br>
&gt;&gt; includes an updated Supply/Demand Outlook for the WCSB, a timely topic<br>
&gt;&gt; as we move into the winter heating season. The revised agenda is<br>
&gt;&gt; attached. You will be advised of any further changes in the agenda.<br>
&gt;&gt; Please let me know by November 1st if you plan on attending the<br>
&gt;&gt; meeting so that Calpine will have an accurate count for lunch. I look<br>
&gt;&gt; forward to seeing everyone on the 9th. If you have any questions<br>
&gt;&gt; please feel free to give me a call at 503-705-2168. Thank you for your<br>
&gt;&gt; patience in getting this meeting rescheduled.  Pat   The Paramount<br>
&gt;&gt; Hotel  808 SW Taylor Street, Portland, OR 97205 (503) 223-9900 * FAX:<br>

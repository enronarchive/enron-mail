Steve -<br>
<br>
 I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If your<br>
team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later  to<br>
start discussing  with them.<br>
<br>
On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest hourly<br>
rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80 hours *<br>
rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be adequate to<br>
put together a short study on your different options.  I will send you a<br>
engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by you<br>
before Friday.<br>
<br>
Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the<br>
Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the other<br>
officers.<br>

<br>
   Hello Steve -<br>
<br>
   Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update - I<br>
   moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago and<br>
   have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management &amp; Pipeline<br>
   Optimization<br>
   projects.<br>
<br>
   I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture has<br>
   a<br>
   strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered<br>
   Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology &amp; technology for<br>
   making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&amp;D<br>
   companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.<br>
   This<br>
   is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:<br>
<br>
<br>
   1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM<br>
   2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)<br>
   3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from<br>
   RCM<br>
   (say $20MM) as part of our &quot;guarantee&quot;<br>
   4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over<br>
   the<br>
   next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.<br>
<br>
   I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am around<br>
   the<br>
   Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to<br>
   discuss<br>
   further.<br>
<br>
   Hope all is well.<br>
<br>

Hi Steve.  The optional headlight fairing and radiator/engine cowling were<br>
options offered by the manufacturer (Honda).  The previous owner purchased the<br>
items and installed them on the bike. They dress the bike up and give it a more<br>
racey/cafe bike type look.   The bike has the factory paint job and stickers.<br>
The base color is white, and the decals are light blue and light mauve.  I work<br>
2 jobs, so I'm pretty much out of pocket during the weekdays. I work my 2nd job<br>
at night and I can't dial long distance; however, if you'd like to call me one<br>
evening I can be reached at 901 397-4587 after 6:00 p.m. weekdays.  The bike's<br>
located in Memphis, TN 38134, probably around 575 miles from you.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
<br>

&gt; Hi Greg. Thanks for the info. When you say it has the optional headlight<br>
&gt; fairing, etc., does that mean they are not on the bike? What color is the<br>
&gt; bike? Do you have a number I can reach you at so we can discuss it further?<br>
&gt; I am very interested and would like to see what we can work out. I need to<br>
&gt; know what city and zip code the bike is in to find out how much it would be<br>
&gt; to ship it. Thanks.<br>

&gt;    Hi Steve, yes I still have the bike for sale, I just decided to sell it<br>
&gt;    last friday (11/23).  I hate to part with it, but I'm trying to raise<br>
&gt;    capital to fund a business venture.  I don't have any pictures of it,<br>
&gt;    but I can borrow my girlfriends digital camera and get you some;<br>
&gt;    however, I won't see her until this friday (11/30), and we are heading<br>
&gt;    out of town until 12/4.  I'll try to see if I can do anything before<br>
&gt;    then, but I can't say for sure, as I don't own a computer or any<br>
&gt;    computer equipment.  I only have computer access at my job.  In<br>
&gt;    reference to shipping cost to Texas, shipping company's usually charge<br>
&gt;    by size, weight, and distance travelled.  The bike doesn't weigh that<br>
&gt;    much, but you'd probably have to check with a truck line to verify a<br>
&gt;    freight prices.  In regard to the title, I do have the title, but<br>
&gt;    it's still in the person's name that I purchased the bike from.  He had<br>
&gt;    it licensed, with tags on it, and rode it on the street.  I bought it<br>
&gt;    just as a pit/play bike.  I take it to local motorcycle races on a<br>
&gt;    trailer as a pit bike and ride it around my neighborhood, so I never<br>
&gt;    licensed it to keep from paying sales tax.  If it becomes an issue, I<br>
&gt;    can retitle it in my name. The unit has somewhere around 980 miles on<br>
&gt;    it, and it has the optional headlight fairing and engine/radiator<br>
&gt;    shroud/cowl.  The only thing that I did to it when I bought it was<br>
&gt;    change all the fluids, lube, check everything over and adjust things as<br>
&gt;    needed.  Let me know if you have any further questions or need more<br>
&gt;    info.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;    Thx.<br>
&gt;<br>

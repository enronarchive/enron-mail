Subject:	Moody's Investors Service downgrads Enron<br>
<br>
Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron Corp.'s long-term debt by one<br>
notch this morning, a move sure to hamper the company's efforts to restore<br>
investor and client confidence.<br>
Shares of Enron fell to seven-year lows this morning, losing $1.51 to trade<br>
at $13.89 in mid-day trading. In the past two weeks the stock has lost more<br>
than half its value, dropping from as high as $35 at the beginning of<br>
October.<br>
Enron's rating was lowered by the bond rating firm from Baa1 to Baa2, where<br>
it will remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said in a statement.<br>
The firm also placed the Houston company's Prime-2 rating for commercial<br>
paper on review for downgrade.<br>
The Baa2 rating is just two notches above what is commonly called &quot;junk<br>
bonds.&quot;<br>

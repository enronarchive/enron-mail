What... no comment on the Steelers Statistics......<br>
<br>
Anyhow, OK if you have a meeting... I'll just stay at Alex's Halloween party<br>
for a little while longer, if you're meeting ends really early you should<br>
walk down to his school, otherwise we'll just look for you at the normal<br>
place...<br>

   Ahhh you foolish, foolish little man.  Not only are you going against<br>
   your<br>
   wife's team.... but you are going against the statistics... that the<br>
   Steelers have always won on Monday Night Football over the past 5<br>
   years....<br>
<br>
   May you crash and burn.......<br>

      Hey,<br>
<br>
      Don't forget to call your benefits group regarding the $$$ that you<br>
   have<br>
      placed in there.  Also don't forget to call Beta and see what the<br>
   deal<br>
      is....<br>
<br>
      I'll be at Alex's school from 4:00 - 4:20 or so, so I'll pick you up<br>
   at<br>
      4:30.<br>
<br>

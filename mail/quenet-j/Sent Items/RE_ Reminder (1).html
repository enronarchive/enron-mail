Ahhh you foolish, foolish little man.  Not only are you going against your<br>
wife's team.... but you are going against the statistics... that the<br>
Steelers have always won on Monday Night Football over the past 5 years....<br>
<br>
May you crash and burn.......<br>

   Hey,<br>
<br>
   Don't forget to call your benefits group regarding the $$$ that you have<br>
   placed in there.  Also don't forget to call Beta and see what the deal<br>
   is....<br>
<br>
   I'll be at Alex's school from 4:00 - 4:20 or so, so I'll pick you up at<br>
   4:30.<br>
<br>

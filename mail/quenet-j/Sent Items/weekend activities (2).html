 <br>
hope your holiday went well ..............<br>
<br>
we close on our &quot;new&quot; new house on wednesday...................... old mr. <br>
Pulte couldn't take up the carpet and lay down the floor so he now owns one <br>
of his own homes again. We now own a home by Village Builders in wood creek. <br>
Bigger home, better rate......Anyway, now we can ride together with the wives <br>
and dogs when go back up to visit Rob and Sherry's parents ranch......We went <br>
up on saturday, 1 hr north of Rob's house....up near Magnolia.......900 acres <br>
....nice house on to of the hill, overlooking the lake , the horses, the <br>
cattle, ....the inground pool ( simba's favorite place) the other 5 dogs <br>
wanted no part of the pool.......<br>
<br>
 Turns out, the ranch is just a &quot;weekend getaway&quot;..........along with the new <br>
house on lake conroe &quot;weekend&quot;. and the beach house on south padre <br>
Island.&quot;weekend also&quot;.......Dad was a private practice Doctor of family <br>
medicine......great guy......we ( you and me) need to get back up there with <br>
the families.....great place to sit outside , suck down beer and get covered <br>
with mud......simba hasn't woken up in 2 days ....think she's ok ????<br>

<div id=msg_body>
you hurt my feelings ........................first , I'm  definetly the <br>
largest user of outside brokers in this entire firm........could possibly do <br>
more than anyone in  this market......30-40 &quot;outside &quot; trades each <br>
day.........second, in this instance he showed me a .25 bid and I hit it, <br>
then i offered evens( sold several hundred) then i wacked the 75's (again <br>
several hundred) then hit all the 50's......               when i come back <br>
to them and ask who I hit they say they have a problem......that it should <br>
have been an offer...when they listened to the tape they &quot;think&quot; he said <br>
&quot;sell&quot;.......myself, I did nothing wrong in this.....then they come back with <br>
another name who will stand in at &quot;even&quot;....... well, make him come upto &gt;25 <br>
and send him the check...........I (we) assume all the risk in the broker <br>
market............brokers collect the commission and have no <br>
position........we use brokers , pay the commission and also end up with a <br>
bad position from &quot;flake&quot; trades..........<br>
<br>
  didn't mean to vent on you .............using brokers carries <br>
risk(execution risk).......<br>
<br>

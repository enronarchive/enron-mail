I CONTACTED BETA FINANCE, I OWE THEM ABOUT 250 OUT OF 600 BALANCE. I<br>
ALSO CONTACTED THE COMPANY THAT CONTROLS OUR DAYCARE CLAIM FORMS. THEY<br>
SAID IF WE COULD GET A STATEMENT FROM CREME SHOWING ALL THE PAYMENTS<br>
MADE IN 2001, I CAN COLLECT ALL THE MONEY IN THE ACCOUNT.      SO<br>
THEREFORE, CAN YOU ASK THE PEOPLE AT CREME IF THEY CAN PROVIDE US WITH<br>
THIS INFO ?<br>
<br>
LATER.<br>

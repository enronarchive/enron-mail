&gt; Enron Said To Be Takeover Target, Shell Tipped As Possible Bidder<br>
&gt; Oct. 28 (Power Finance &amp; Risk)<br>
&gt; Enron, which 12 months ago was the darling of the energy markets, has<br>
&gt; become increasingly vulnerable to a takeover bid following the recent<br>
&gt; collapse of its share price, according to bankers and analysts. Royal<br>
&gt; Dutch/Shell is one likely bidder, they say, noting that Enron's relatively<br>
&gt; modest market capitalization--down to $11.5 billion late last week from a<br>
&gt; high of more than $55 billion--means that Shell and other potential<br>
&gt; acquirers would have little trouble digesting it whole. Cerris Tavinor, a<br>
&gt; spokeswoman for Shell, declined to comment. Calls to Enron were not<br>
&gt; returned.<br>
&gt; An M&amp;A banker in London says the Anglo-Dutch oil giant was rumored to have<br>
&gt; approached Enron unsuccessfully in August. An analyst in New York adds<br>
&gt; Shell has courted Enron for more than three years. &quot;[Shell]'s downstream<br>
&gt; power business InterGen has not been as successful as it and its partner<br>
&gt; Bechtel hoped, especially in the U.S., and this would be a great fit,&quot; he<br>
&gt; continues.<br>
&gt; While many energy concerns would love to get their hands on Enron's hugely<br>
&gt; successful gas and electricity trading business, its forays into water,<br>
&gt; broadband and pulp and paper, might prove less attractive. Bidders may<br>
&gt; want to cherry pick the best parts of the business, reasons Peter Fusaro,<br>
&gt; president of Global Change Associates in New York. Still, he says &quot;there<br>
&gt; is a distinct possibility that it could be bought outright.&quot;<br>
&gt; Another obstacle to any sale is believed to be CEO Kenneth Lay's<br>
&gt; unwillingness to sell the company at such a low stock price. Still, Lay<br>
&gt; has already given up the executive reins once, and at 61, he would<br>
&gt; probably be willing to sell if the premium was significantly rich, argues<br>
&gt; one New York based banker. Another adds that Lay will probably wait for<br>
&gt; the share price to recover before he would even consider talking to<br>
&gt; bidders.<br>
&gt; Bankers argue that potential bidders would be unwilling to ride roughshod<br>
&gt; over Lay's wishes through a hostile bid as most of Enron's value is tied<br>
&gt; up in intellectual capital. Hostile bidders run the risk that senior staff<br>
&gt; will jump ship, argues a London banker.<br>
&gt; Another obstacle to any bid is concern that Enron may have additional<br>
&gt; skeletons in its financial closet. Last week's stock market selloff was<br>
&gt; prompted by Enron unexpectedly writing off some $1.2 billion in equity<br>
&gt; resulting from the termination of contracts with a special purpose vehicle<br>
&gt; linked to Peter Fastow, cfo. Analysts fear that Enron may have to<br>
&gt; terminate similar contracts over the next quarters.<br>

--------------- Authored by: Jeff Dietert ----------------<br>
OUR VIEW:  ENE is down huge (-80% for the year, and trading at only<br>
7.5xFY02) and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock.<br>
More pressure is likely today on the news of S&amp;P revising its long-term<br>
ratings outlook to negative (based on the decline in market capitalization)<br>
and ENE's additional draw on its credit facilities (which does not change<br>
its net debt, but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in<br>
the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating, which<br>
could break covenants and restrict liquidity).  We believe the major issues<br>
are: 1) management's ability to regain the confidence of the street and<br>
persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate<br>
the expected earnings and cash flow,  2) ENE must maintain its investment<br>
grade credit rating, 3) ENE must successfully execute its divestiture<br>
plans, and 4) ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the<br>
write-down in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book.<br>
<br>
IF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears, these fears<br>
could become a self fulfilling prophecy.  In the potentially vicious cycle,<br>
investor fears could drive the stock down, the lower stock prices force the<br>
rating agencies to consider downgrades, potentially lower credit ratings<br>
force counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE, limiting ENE's to<br>
generate earnings and cash flow.  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to<br>
clarify the issues.  We expect ENE to put together a more complete<br>
explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to<br>
stabilize the stock.   If/when ENE schedules a conference call or road<br>
show, we would consider this a bullish sign.  Absent further clarification,<br>
the stock is likely to continue to be weak.   Our gut feel is that ENE can<br>
pull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually<br>
the stock gets valued on earnings (with upside potential to $25+/sh over<br>
the next 12 to 18 month period), rather than break-up value ($16/sh-see<br>
below).  We believe new money (with high risk tolerance!) should wait until<br>
ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.<br>
<br>
ENE's VIEW:  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur<br>
Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than<br>
an approximate $200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change.<br>
With no further asset write-downs, and roughly $890 MM in asset<br>
divestitures ($390 MM India E&amp;P, $250 MM Puerto Rico power plant, and $250<br>
MM Brazilian power plant) in 4Q01, ENE's D/TC ratio is likely to decline<br>
from 50% at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48% at the end of the year.  After<br>
the close of the Portland General divestiture, expected by year-end 2002,<br>
we expect its D/TC to fall below 45% (we are projecting FCF to be<br>
break-even in FY02).  We estimate that ENE's interest coverage at the end<br>
of 3Q01 is 3.5x.  ENE is currently rated BBB+ by S&amp;P and Baa1 by Moodys,<br>
and would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade.  For<br>
comparison purposes, S&amp;P's BBB median D/TC is 47.4% and EBITDA/Int. Exp.<br>
coverage is 6.1x, while BB (non-investment grade) median D/TC is 61.3% and<br>
interest coverage is 3.8x.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANCE OF ENE's INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING:  We believe that ENE's<br>
Wholesale segments, which generates 80% of its EBIT, would be<br>
noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade.  In<br>
addition, a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger<br>
the issuance of 50 MM shares of common stock and $1 B in convertible<br>
preferred stock associated with ENE's off-balance sheet structured<br>
financing vehicles.  We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an<br>
<br>
investment grade rating.  Moodys has its BBB+ rating under review for a<br>
possible downgrade.   Last night S&amp;P revised its long-term ratings outlook<br>
to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market<br>
capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the company's<br>
financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to<br>
rebuild its balance sheet.<br>
<br>
BREAK-UP VALUE:  We believe ENE 's Wholesale America ($2.7 B in TTM<br>
EBITDA), Wholesale Europe ($900 MM) and Retail ($450 MM) segments are<br>
conservatively worth a 4x multiple (recent multiples have been higher, but<br>
we are discounting due to limited buying interest) or $16.2 B.  The Gas<br>
Pipeline segment ($820 MM) and Global Assets ($200 MM) valued at a 6x<br>
multiple are worth $6.1 B.  PGE valued at the divestiture price is $2.9 B.<br>
Total asset value is conservatively $25 B, vs. debt of $13 B, leaving $12 B<br>
or $16/sh for equity investors in a break-up scenario.  The challenge is,<br>
if ENE loses its investment grade rating, the value ($16.2 B) of its<br>
Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromised--leaving<br>
little for equity investors.<br>
<br>
POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS:  ENE's Global Assets portfolio<br>
includes assets with $6 B in book value (ENE's total gross PP&amp;E is $14 B)<br>
that has generated an EBIT loss of $18 MM (EBITDA of +$168 MM) over the<br>
last 12-month period (4Q00 to 3Q01).  The Global Assets portfolio includes<br>
Elektro (an electric utility in Brazil), Dabhol (power plant in India), TGS<br>
(a natural gas pipeline in Argentina), Azurix and Enron Wind operations.<br>
These assets seem ripe for a write-down although the company argues that it<br>
has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not<br>
impaired.  ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of<br>
these assets has not been impaired.  The write-down of these assets would<br>
reduce shareholder equity and ENE's D/TC, threatening its credit rating.<br>
It is not clear that ENE put all its under-performing assets in the Global<br>
Assets portfolio.  There could be other poor performing assets in other<br>
segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business.<br>
<br>
ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS:  ENE's counter-parties seem to be supportive and<br>
have not indicated any change in business activity.  EnronOnline trading<br>
volume was slightly above average yesterday.  Some energy traders have<br>
bought ENE in their personal accounts, convinced that ENE core marketing<br>
business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have<br>
over-reacted.  Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights<br>
solidifying ENE's financial strategy (hopefully for a more complete<br>
discussion with the street?).<br>
<br>
THE SEC INQUIRY:  We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its<br>
attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with<br>
the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow<br>
participated.  We do not expect the SEC to find any legal<br>
wrong-doing--although this doesn't mean that they won't express qualitative<br>
concern over the appearance of the transactions.<br>

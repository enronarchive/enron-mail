HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 23, 2001 -- You can hear them approaching from hundreds of yards<br>
away. That guttural, rumbling, roar can only denote one thing, a<br>
Harley is near. Harley-Davidson Motor Company (Milwaukee, Wi.)<br>
(NYSE:HDI) has been an institution in the motorcycle industry since<br>
1903 when William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson first painted their<br>
names on the gas tank of the first Harley-Davidson (H-D) Motorcycle.<br>
Originally designed to be a racing bike, the H-D bike won its first<br>
race in 1905 and never looked back.<br>
	   As the most popular motorcycle in America, H-D is constantly<br>
growing in an effort to keep pace with ever-increasing demand, and to<br>
keep ahead of the research curve on new product development. The new<br>
millennium appears to bode well for H-D as they have announced plans<br>
to spend approximately $250 million on capital projects in 2001 alone.<br>
This includes grassroot plants in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and<br>
will position H-D to maintain its lead in the U.S. motorcycle<br>
industry. In addition to planning brand new facilities, H-D is also<br>
expanding and upgrading their existing plants and research centers. In<br>
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, H-D is planning a 75,000 square foot (sqft)<br>
office building addition and a 65,000 sqft plant expansion.<br>
	   These expansions will enable H-D to maintain 800 jobs and create<br>
393 new positions, something the Governor of the state is fully<br>
behind. &quot;The company is expanding and upgrading equipment at two of<br>
its Wisconsin facilities,&quot; says Wisconsin Governor Scott McCallum.<br>
&quot;The quality of its products has helped raise Wisconsin's viability<br>
around the world.&quot; H-D shipped 200,000 motorcycles for the first time<br>
in company history last year. H-D's internal company goals had<br>
initially called for reaching that sales milestone by 2003, the year<br>
they celebrate their first century of business.<br>

manufacturer, and produces heavyweight motorcycles and offers a<br>
complete line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel, and general<br>

Hi, Connie!  <br>
<br>
The trading groups (the ones that used to make all the money) are still working full days.  We're trying to trade, but our number of counterparties decreases daily.  I don't know if we'll make it through the next week.  They are laying off people this week, so I hear, in other groups.  I don't know who has been notified.  We may all be walking out the door soon.<br>
<br>
As for the kids, Yes, Kali still believes in Santa Claus.  I don't know if she knows and is not fessing up!  We'll be here in Houston for Christmas.  Give us a call when you get here; we'd love to see you.  <br>
<br>
Thank goodness I already bought the kids' Christmas gifts.  They haven't written their lists yet.  <br>

hey Susan,<br>
<br>
How is it going this week?  I heard that people are mostly sitting around<br>
during the morning then going to bars in the afternoon...or is that just in<br>
the London office?  Are people even coming into the office?  Heather Kendall<br>
said she will be let go just before Christmas.  I can't believe how they are<br>
laying people off just before Christmas, the whole scenerio is like a bad<br>
movie.  She's coming to visit this week, so maybe we can cheer her up with<br>
some Christmas shopping in Rothenburg, it's an adorable little mid-evil town<br>
that has the greatest Christmas decoration stores ever...and they are open<br>
year round.  We took Julie there when she was here a couple of weeks ago.<br>
<br>
How are the kids doing?  Does Kali still believe in Santa Claus?  We are<br>
going to spend Christmas with Melissa and family.  Christmas is just not<br>
much fun without children to watch.  Armin needs a vacation, well we both<br>
do.  We leave on Dec 21 and CAN'T WAIT TO GO!  Are ya'll staying home for<br>
Christmas?<br>
<br>
Well, just wanted to check on you!  Take care...connie<br>

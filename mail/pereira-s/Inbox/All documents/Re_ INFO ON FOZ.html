Hi Susan,<br>
˜˜˜ Went by the travel agent's  today to see what she found for your trip to <br>
Foz.˜ I'm still waiting on  some confirmed prices but a strong estimate would <br>
be between R$1,000 to R$1,300  and depending on the exchange it would be <br>
between US$500 and US$650 per  person.˜ The price includes airfare, hotel 2 <br>
nights, complimentary  breakfast all mornings, transport from and to airport, <br>
english speaking guide  and driver (he also takes you to the Argentina side), <br>
tours on the Brazil and  Argentina sides, boat tour at the bottom of the <br>
falls, and a tour of the aviary  of tropical birds of Brazil.˜ There's also a <br>
helicopter tour you can take  but it's not included in the price.˜ This is <br>
with TAM airline.˜  <br>
˜˜˜ We would stay in Rio Sunday,  Monday and then on Tuesday you and Renato <br>
would leave Rio around 11am and arrive  in Foz around 2:30 and get to the <br>
hotel around 3:30.˜ You would spend all  day Wednesday there and leave <br>
Thursday at 3:30 to arrive in SP at  5:00PM.<br>
˜˜˜ When she confirms the prices  I'll send you all the details.˜ Until then, <br>
let me know what you think of  this so far.<br>
˜<br>
˜˜˜  Jan<br>

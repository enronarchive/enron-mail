Subject: Chicago Summer Intern Interviews<br>
<br>
Hello U of Chicago Recruiting Team,<br>
<br>
I am about to bombard you with all of the resumes that have been submitted <br>
for summer internship with Enron..  We are needing to choose 12 candidates to <br>
invite, with about six alternates.  We are having two schedules which means <br>
that will be interviewing 24 people total.  The Career Placement office <br>
requires that 50% of you list be open for bid, therefore 12 candidates will <br>
be open.<br>
<br>
I am going to forward the e-mails that have the resumes attached. Please <br>
review and choose 12 invites and 6 alternates.<br>
<br>
I am also going to forward the teams commitment to participation as it stands <br>
so far.<br>
<br>
We will be needing 4 interviewers day one and 2 on day two.<br>
<br>
Let us try and meet on Tuesday to discuss the resumes.  We need to have our <br>
choices to the Career Placement Office.  Please let me know what time is good <br>
for Tuesday.<br>
<br>
Thanks -=- Paul L.<br>

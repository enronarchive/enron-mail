Thanks for your help.  It sounds like your girl scout outings are a little <br>
more exotic than ours.  Our last event was an overnight campout in one of the <br>
girls' backyards.  The girls had a lot of fun.  I was lucky and didn't have <br>
to volunteer.  Michael got to be an only child for the night and got all the <br>
attention.  He loves it when Kali spends the night away!!<br>
<br>
Talk to you soon.<br>
<br>

Hi Susan,<br>
˜˜˜ Glad you guys are going to  Foz, I think you'll really enjoy it.˜ Don't <br>
worry about giving me your  credit card number, etc.˜ It will be easier for <br>
me to pay for it from here  and then you can just reimburse us.˜ In fact, you <br>
can give a check to Papi  and he can deposit it for us there.<br>
˜˜˜ I'm taking the Girl Scouts on  an all day outing today to an indian <br>
village so I won't talk with the travel  agent today.˜ However,˜ I'll call <br>
her and then tomorrow go by and  finalize everything.˜ Afterwards I'll send <br>
you all of the  details.<br>
˜˜˜ Hope your week goes  well.......give the kids a big hug.<br>
˜˜˜ Jan<br>
˜<br>
PS˜ Just a reminder to get your visas, I  don't know if you have done that <br>
already.<br>
˜˜˜  tchau..........<br>
<br>

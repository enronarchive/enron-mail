 SONY TAKES ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR DVD <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Sony is taking entertainment to the next frontier! The DVP-FX1  portable DVD <br>
player will be the first of its kind in space, playing  movies and music for <br>
three astronauts aboard the International Space  Station. <br>
<br>
Five Sony portable DVD players will be on board, along with about  50 DVDs <br>
and CDs, forming the first audio/video entertainment system  in space. The <br>
ultrathin units are encased in a magnesium alloy housing  that's not <br>
available on any other portable DVD player. The casing was  integral in the <br>
player's selection to go into space, as it provides  the lightweight <br>
durability needed for space travel. <br>
<br>
The DVP-FX1 will be challenged by some unearthly conditions. The  shuttle <br>
taking the astronauts to the Space Station will lift off at  a speed of 200 <br>
mph when it clears the tower, before reaching an orbital  speed of 17,500 mph <br>
and encountering a maximum of three-G forces. After  having endured such <br>
extremes, the player will rely on its Advanced  SmoothScanT Picture Search <br>
for seamless transitions between video  frames. The limited space aboard the <br>
shuttle and the International  Space Station is no problem for the DVP-FX1, <br>
which is slimmer than  three stacked DVD cases, even with the battery. <br>
<br>
What will the astronauts watch in space? Go to http://www.sonydvdinspace.com/ <br>

I checked the website for the hotels at Foz.  The tourism website is down.  <br>
It looks like  a great place.  I'll have to convince Renato to go (you know, <br>
he might miss out on working out for one day).  I think the kids might like <br>
it too.  Did Alexia and Sebastien like it or was it too much walking?  I <br>
asked my boss about it.  He went with his family when he was living in <br>
Argentina.  They really enjoyed it.  Can you go ahead and check on flights <br>
and which hotel to stay at?  The Hotel Colonial Iguacu e Spa looked like the <br>
nicer one on the internet.  I imagine the flights will be cheaper booking <br>
them there.  Is that right?  Let me know the airline and I'll check here.  I <br>
guess we would go on July 4 and return on July 5.  Also, would y'all want to <br>
go as well?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help.<br>
<br>

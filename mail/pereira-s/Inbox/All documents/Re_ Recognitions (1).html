Unfortunately, I will not be able to help you sort recognitions during the <br>
day on Tuesday -- I can't get off work on that day.  If you are able to sort <br>
our troop's recognitions (troop 12357) by Tuesday evening, I would love to <br>
come by and pick them up.  Our last Brownie meeting is on Wednesday <br>
afternoon, and I wanted to get everything to our troop leader Wednesday <br>
morning before work.  Let me know what time would be convenient for me to <br>
come by.  I have a Southside Place city council meeting to attend at 7 pm but <br>
could come by before.....<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

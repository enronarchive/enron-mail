The only info I had from you is that we owed ProEnergy 11,035 mmbtu.  I asked <br>
you if we had any other outstanding imbalances with Cinergy or its <br>
precursors.  You gave me the Onyx volume, but I had already negotiated the <br>
deal.  Whose imbalance is the 10,644 mmbtu??<br>

Daniel Kieran with Cinergy/Producer's Energy called me because he wanted <br>
clarification on something in the contract.  He thinks were forgetting about <br>
the imbalance due LRP of 10,644.  I thought you said the reason the price was <br>
so low was because that imbalance had been taken into consideration, so in a <br>
sense we are netting the two.  Is this correct?  Also, was the Oryx imbalance <br>
of (770) taken into consideration in the agreement below?<br>

Cinergy has agreed to settle the imbalance of 11,035 mmbtu owed them at <br>
$1.77/mmbtu.  Please prepare the paperwork showing us paying them $19,531.95 <br>
to clear this imbalance.<br>
<br>

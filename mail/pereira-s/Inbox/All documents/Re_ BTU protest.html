Joe put a call into Destin today, but our contact was out.  Once we talk to <br>
the right person and find out exactly what needs to be done, I think we would <br>
be very interested in having Rebel draft the letter.  I'll let you know as <br>
soon as I know...<br>

I have told Rebel that you and I have discussed the BTU issue and the<br>
complaint.  Harvey Petter with Rebel has offered to draft a letter.  Would<br>
this be acceptable for you?  If it meets with Enron's approval it could be<br>
sent by your office.  It might save you and your attorneys a lot of time,<br>
but that is not how you might want to handle it.<br>
<br>
Let me know.<br>

Thanks for the email.  Kali was not able to make last Sunday's game due to a <br>
schedule conflict that I had.  Plus, she will not go to the last game because <br>
her best friend's birthday party is at the same time.  I had her skip another <br>
friend's party to make the one game she did participate in (all the softball <br>
girls schedule their parties on Sunday so as not to conflict with those <br>
games!!).  If it's not too late, do not order a trophy for her.  She really <br>
was never much of a team participant.  I'm hoping her enthusiasm this fall <br>
will be like last fall and not this spring.  Thanks for all your help, time <br>
and effort.<br>
<br>

P.S.-<br>
Do you know who some of the U10 girls coaches will be??  Will you be <br>
coaching?  I did not sign up to coach because I may asst. coach my son's U6 <br>
team.<br>

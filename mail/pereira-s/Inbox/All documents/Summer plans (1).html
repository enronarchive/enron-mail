Ok, here's the plan.....<br>
<br>
Kali and Michael will leave for Brazil with y'all on Wed. the 27th on the <br>
evening flight (?).  Let me know the exact Continental flight number so we <br>
can make the reservations.  We'll get the seat assignments coordinated later <br>
I guess.<br>
<br>
Renato and I will take a flight out of Houston on the evening of July 6, <br>
arriving Saturday morning.   The four of us will return to Houston on the <br>
next Fri. night flight (13th).  I think we've decided not to go to Foz do <br>
Iguacu, since we have so little time.  Instead, we'd like to go to Rio for a <br>
few days.  Can we all go together and drive.  Maybe you could get hotel <br>
reservations there?<br>
<br>
Let me know what you think.   We're excited about the trip.  The kids can't <br>
wait.<br>
<br>

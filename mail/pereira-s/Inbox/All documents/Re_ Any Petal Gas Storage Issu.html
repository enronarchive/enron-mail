Subject: Any Petal Gas Storage Issues?<br>
<br>
As reported previously in the trade press, Petal Gas Storage has decided to <br>
build its own pipeline to connect its storage facility in Forrest Co., MS to <br>
interconnections with Southern Natural, Destin, and Transco in Clarke and <br>
Jasper Cos., MS.  We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket <br>
No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20 <br>
deadline.  Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 700,000 <br>
Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.  The project calls for about 59 <br>
miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of <br>
about $94,343,700.<br>
<br>
As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions <br>
and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for <br>
authority to charge negotiated rates.  Petal also requested approval of <br>
certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the <br>
contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its <br>
affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.<br>
<br>
Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of <br>
our intervention.  The certificate application is 635 pages, not including <br>
another 778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request <br>
a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.<br>

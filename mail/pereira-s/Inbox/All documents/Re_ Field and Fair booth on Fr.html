Renato and I are already signed up to work Kali's class booth and our son's <br>
class booth--all at different times.  I don't think we'll  be able to help <br>
all afternoon at one booth, but if something changes I would be more than <br>
happy to help Mary out.<br>

Dear Second Grade parents, <br>
<br>
Our class booth is the pinata booth and the booth chair is Mary Rothwell. <br>
˜As  <br>
you may know, she is expecting a baby in early April. ˜She is still willing  <br>
to run the booth and prepare the pinatas before the fair but will need  <br>
someone to help her that day since she will have her newborn with her. ˜ <br>
Duties would begin mid morning with setup and continue until 2:30 or 3:00  <br>
with cleanup. ˜During F&amp; F hours from 11:00 - 3:00 her helper would need to  <br>
help run the booth, hanging the pinatas from the tree, collecting tickets,  <br>
etc. ˜There are also several parent volunteer hourly slots that have not <br>
been  <br>
filled - one slot from 1:00 - 2:00 and two slots from 2:00- 3:00. <br>
<br>
Could any of you help with any of this? ˜If so, please email me and I will  <br>
let her know. <br>
<br>
Thanks! <br>
Margaret Pierce <br>
Room Parent<br>

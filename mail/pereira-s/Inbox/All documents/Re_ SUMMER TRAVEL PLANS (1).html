I was looking at the wrong week.  Sorry, stress and sleep deprivation are my <br>
only excuses.  How much time should we spend in Rio?  Should we leave for Foz <br>
on the 11th?  I just heard about the Cataratas this morning from Scott Neal.  <br>
That was the place he suggested and that sounds great.  I'll work on Renato <br>
when he gets back in town.  <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Hi susan,<br>
˜˜˜ Glad to hear that you're  interested in the Foz.˜ I think it would be a <br>
great trip for you to take,  although I'm confused about the dates of the 4th <br>
and 5th.˜ Don't forget,  the six of us will be in Ilha de Comandatuba for the <br>
week of June 30 til July  7th.˜ If we stick to the original schedule we would <br>
all be getting into  S’o Paulo Saturday the 7th.˜ The driver would pick up <br>
you and Renato  and you guys would arrive at the house a few hours before <br>
us.˜  <br>
˜˜˜˜ What could easily work  is for all of us to go to Rio on Sunday the 8th, <br>
spend a few days there and  then, you and Renato could fly directly to Foz <br>
from Rio and the kids and I would  drive back to s’o Paulo.˜ You guys could <br>
then fly into S’o  Paulo from Foz.<br>
˜˜˜ The hotel I would suggest at  the Foz is the Cataratas.˜ It's located <br>
within walking distance of the  falls on the Brazil side and set inside the <br>
national reserve forrest with all  kinds of walking trails.˜ They might offer <br>
a service to get to the  Argentina side of the falls, I'll check into that.˜ <br>
If not you just take a  taxi or car service.˜ <br>
˜˜˜ When we went we stayed at  Mabu which had all of these thermal swimming <br>
pools, large grounds, pond  etc.˜ It was more for the kids to enjoy.˜ Our <br>
kids liked the falls but  after walking on one side of it had no interest for <br>
the other.........too much  walking.˜ It would be a nice get-away for the two <br>
of you I  think.<br>
˜˜˜ I'll check into flights and  hotels today and let you know what I find <br>
out.˜ I haven't heard much about  Hotel Conial IguaØa, I'll see what I can <br>
find on it here.<br>
˜˜˜ I'll be in touch  soon..Jan<br>
PS˜ Let Renato know that just finished  having a workout room built at the <br>
house.˜ Also, he can enjoy some great  running in front of the beach while <br>
you're in Rio --˜˜ so hopefully he  won't suffer too much withdrawal <br>
!.................have a good  one<br>
<br>

<br>
   dulcet \DUHL-sit\, adjective:<br>
   1. Pleasing to the ear; melodious; harmonious.<br>
   2. Generally pleasing, soothing, or agreeable.<br>
   3. (Archaic) Sweet to the taste.<br>
<br>
     If  you want to catch up with our most famous songster, the<br>
     nightingale,  just  visit  Minsmere at the end of April, or<br>
     early  May,  and  stand on the edge of the car park. You'll<br>
     soon hear the dulcet tones of the poets' favourite bird.<br>
     --Stephen  Moss,  &quot;Birdwatch,&quot; [1]The Guardian, October 23,<br>
     2000<br>
<br>
     Amanda . . . rages at her young 'uns in a voice that may<br>
     have been full of dulcet notes when she turned the heads of<br>
     her  gentleman  callers  in  her  youth,  but has now grown<br>
     hard-edged and ringing, like a cracked bell.<br>
     --Hal Hinson, [2]Washington Post, November 11, 1987<br>
<br>
     Just  as my eyelids started to get heavy and my brain began<br>
     to  relax  its hold on wakefulness -- bam! -- the less than<br>
     dulcet  tones  of  Britain's  top  breakfast  DJ started to<br>
     emanate from my radio alarm.<br>
     --&quot;Secs in the City,&quot; [3]The Guardian, July 30, 2001<br>
     _________________________________________________________<br>

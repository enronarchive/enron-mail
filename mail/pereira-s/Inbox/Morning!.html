Dear Susan,<br>
<br>
Well how's it going now?  Have they formed a salvage plan for the company?<br>
<br>
I heard that Cuba Waddlington past away.  He had bone cancer?  I'm very<br>
sorry to hear that, he wasn't so old either.  Was he still Frank's boss?<br>
What's with Frank these days?  And Karen?<br>
<br>
It's sooooo cold here!  The high maybe 32Â° F, MAYBE.  So, I am freezing to<br>
death!  I've been staying in mostly, decorating and wrapping presents.  I<br>
love this time of year!  I have been making Christmas gift baskets (filled<br>
with wine, candies and chocolates) for our important clients and business<br>
partners.  They look so nice sitting all around our office that I don't want<br>
to give them away.  I bought little boxes of chocolates filled with schnapps<br>
for the delivery people and postmen.  When you have kids, you get your<br>
fullfillment of wrapping and giving, but when you don't, you have to focus<br>
that energy somewhere!  We have hung icycle lights inside and out, the<br>
germans make some that are like a meter long...we hung them inside, from the<br>
galary and upper floor of the foyer, then hung american icycle lights (they<br>
are much brighter) that Julie sent us outside.  It's so festive.  Are your<br>
kids getting excited?  Kids make Christmas.  (It looks like we MIGHT have a<br>
new baby by the end of the year, afterall.  Melissa's doctor is thinking<br>
that his first due date, Dec 31, could be right on target!  WE HOPE SOOO!)<br>
<br>
Hope that you and your family are all doing well.  And I hope that you are<br>
able to get into the Christmas spirit, in spite of all that's been<br>
happening.<br>
<br>
HAPPY HOLIDAYS!<br>
Connie<br>
<br>

   Word of the Day for Tuesday October 16, 2001:<br>
<br>
   panjandrum \pan-JAN-druhm\, noun:<br>
   An important personage or pretentious official.<br>
<br>
     Needless  to  say,  when  governors  and  ministers and the<br>
     panjandrums  of  British  public life asked these appointed<br>
     advisers and those from whose ranks they were largely drawn<br>
     for  their  views  on democratic development, they gave the<br>
     answers that might have been expected.<br>
     --Christopher Patten, East and West<br>
<br>
     And   so   I  have  appointed  myself  the  chairman,  High<br>
     Panjandrum,   Grand   Inquisitor--and   sole  member--of  a<br>
     grievance committee of my own making.<br>
     --Alan K. Simpson, [1]Right in the Old Gazoo<br>
     _________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
   Panjandrum was coined by Samuel Foote (17201777) in a piece of<br>
   nonsense writing:<br>
<br>
     So  she  went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make<br>
     an apple-pie; and at the same time a great she-bear, coming<br>
     up  the  street,  pops  its  head  into the shop. &quot;What! No<br>
     soap?&quot;  So  he  died,  and she very imprudently married the<br>
     barber:  and  there  were  present  the Picninnies, and the<br>
     Joblillies,  and  the  Garyulies,  and the grand Panjandrum<br>
     himself,  with the little round button at top, and they all<br>
     fell  to  playing  the  game of catch-as-catch-can till the<br>
     gunpowder ran out at the heels of their boots.<br>
<br>
   It  was  composed  on  the  spot  to  challenge  actor Charles<br>
   Macklin's  claim  that  he could memorize anything. Macklin is<br>
   said to have refused to repeat a word of it.<br>

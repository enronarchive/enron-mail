   Word of the Day for Sunday October 21, 2001:<br>
<br>
   ludic \LOO-dik\, adjective:<br>
   Of or relating to play; characterized by play; playful.<br>
<br>
     Um,  there's  only  one  problem:  her mother. Who, being a<br>
     substantial executive, has a somewhat different attitude to<br>
     the  worth  of  the  professions  than  her  wastrel, ludic<br>
     husband.<br>
     --Pat Kane, &quot;Pleasing papa,&quot; [1]The Guardian, July 11, 2001<br>
<br>
     He  is  indeed the outstanding imaginative prose stylist of<br>
     his  generation,  with  an  entirely  recognizable literary<br>
     manner,  fizzy  and playful (I am trying to avoid the words<br>
     &quot;pyrotechnic&quot; and &quot;ludic&quot;).<br>
     --Geoffrey  Wheatcroft,  &quot;What  Kingsley Can Teach Martin,&quot;<br>
     [2]The Atlantic, September 2000<br>
<br>
     But  within  this  ludic tale there lurks a tragedy of love<br>
     and  loss  that  does  not  lose  its  tenderness even when<br>
     embedded  in  [the  author's] perpetually farcical frame of<br>
     mind.<br>
     --Richard   Bernstein,   &quot;Lalita,   Post-Modern  Object  of<br>
     Desire,&quot; [3]New York Times, September 8, 1999<br>
     _________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
   Ludic derives from Latin ludus, &quot;play.&quot; Ludicrous, &quot;amusing or<br>
   laughable,&quot; shares the same root.<br>

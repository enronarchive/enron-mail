Dear Susan,<br>
<br>
That's just INCREDIBLE!  Is the SEC investigating all of the execs that<br>
left?  Scott had said that they were all just crooks, but I didn't know if<br>
maybe his opinion was a little tainted, guess it wasn't.  Julie hasn't said<br>
much at all about anything either, just that it's not the same place<br>
anymore.  I am so sorry for all of you with those worthless options!  What<br>
is Lay saying he's going to do to fix this and moral???  I'm sure everyone<br>
is ready to leave.  How did it get so bad so fast?!  Just incredible. I sure<br>
hope things are going better where Renato is working!<br>
<br>
So, did you buy you a new SUV, you wrote that you were thinking about it.<br>
We need something like that so bad.  We have a car that's more for sporting<br>
around in than using in everyday use.  The problem for me here though is<br>
parking, I HATE PARKING IN EUROPE!  So I couldn't handle anything very big<br>
either.  I actually love those little &quot;Smarts&quot; have you seen them, I doubt<br>
that they have any in the states, they are a little 2 seater but it has more<br>
space in the back for shopping than our BMW does in it's trunk. AND IT'S<br>
GREAT FOR PARKING! But all that has to wait until we get this house finished<br>
and figure out if we are making any money in this business, being it's our<br>
first year and Armin's parents made us take the business without EVER seeing<br>
a balance sheet.  All I can say  so far, is that we are paying our bills and<br>
eating good!<br>
<br>
Hope you have a good weekend, you need it I'm sure after this week.  Tell<br>
Renato hello for me.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
Connie<br>
<br>

I got the email you forwarded to me.  Have you responded to Suzanne <br>
Sugarbaker yet?  I would be happy(?) to talk with her, so please feel free to <br>
forward my email address to her.  If I don't hear back from you today, I will <br>
probably email Suzanne directly this weekend.  Maybe I can clarify a few <br>
issues with her.  As for Cindy Colvin's &quot;presentation,&quot; I've spoken with <br>
Richard Rothfelder on how we might handle future situations like this.  In <br>
the meantime, I'm taking extra vitamins to thicken my skin.  <br>
<br>
Let me know what responses you receive today on the RFP.  I know we will need <br>
to schedule a committee meeting in the next week or so.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Susan<br>
<br>
P.S.-<br>
Please email me back today at our home email address :  <br>
pereira@houston.rr.com.  I'm leaving early for a doctor appt.<br>

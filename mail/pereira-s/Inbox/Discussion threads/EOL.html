There are several little features that EOL traders such as myself would like <br>
to see on the website and stack manager.  I realize that there may be bigger <br>
issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey <br>
Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??  <br>
For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack <br>
manager.  Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the <br>
website, so people could shade products different colors.  This might cut <br>
down on trades made in error.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

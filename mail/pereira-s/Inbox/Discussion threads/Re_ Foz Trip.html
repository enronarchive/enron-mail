Looks fine, Jan.  Thanks for taking care of this for us.  Let me know the <br>
exact amount if the exchange rate changes.  I'll give a check to Papi to <br>
deposit in your account.  <br>
<br>
I hope you are all doing well.  Maman told us of your struggles to get the <br>
medication you need.  I hope things work out.  How are the kids doing?  Kali <br>
and Michael are very excited that school is almost out--just two more weeks.  <br>
They can't wait for Alexia and Sebastien to get here.<br>
<br>
See you soon..<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
<br>

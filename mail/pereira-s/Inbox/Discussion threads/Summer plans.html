Hi, Jan.  I hope you are all doing well.  Maman has updated us on your <br>
mother's condition.  I know it must be stressful, especially from long <br>
distance.  Kali liked her birthday gifts.  Believe it or not, we didn't <br>
already have the World Pup movie. We had rented it back in February and the <br>
kids liked it.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if you got my last email before we left on vacation, but I was <br>
wondering what your travel schedule was in June.  When will you be arriving, <br>
when will you be returning (Kali has warmed up to the idea of travelling <br>
without us on the plane), etc.  The earliest we could leave for Brazil would <br>
be the evening of Friday, July 6.  We would probably need to return to <br>
Houston by July 14.  Let me know how that sounds.  Also, if we need to <br>
reschedule for another time until you get things straight for your mother, <br>
let me know.  That's certainly more important.<br>
<br>
Talk to you soon.....<br>
<br>
Susan<br>
<br>

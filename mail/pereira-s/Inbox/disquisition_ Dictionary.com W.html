   Word of the Day for Sunday October 14, 2001:<br>
<br>
   disquisition \dis-kwuh-ZISH-uhn\, noun:<br>
   A formal discourse on a subject.<br>
<br>
     Hence,  although  the  publisher  calls Mr. Roth's work &quot;An<br>
     Essay  on  Evil  in  the Modern World,&quot; it will be found to<br>
     differ  materially in approach and manner of treatment from<br>
     the usual disquisition on an ancient topic.<br>
     --Percy   Hutchison,  &quot;That  Old  Arch-Enemy  of  Man,  the<br>
     Antichrist,&quot; [1]New York Times, May 12, 1935<br>
<br>
     Gore was partial to eye-glazing disquisitions on reciprocal<br>
     trade.<br>
     --Bill Turque, Inventing Al Gore: A Biography<br>
<br>
     The  treatises and pamphlets of the late eighteenth century<br>
     about the reform of commerce were considered, very soon, to<br>
     be disquisitions of only limited and technical interest.<br>
     --Emma Rothschild, Economic Sentiments<br>
<br>
    . . .  a  rambling  disquisition, with copious historical<br>
     discussion and many anecdotes.<br>
     --James McCourt, Delancey's Way<br>
     _________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
   Disquisition  comes  from  Latin disquisitio, from disquirere,<br>
   &quot;to  inquire  into,  to investigate,&quot; from dis- + quaerere &quot;to<br>
   seek.&quot;   It  is  related  to  inquire  (&quot;to  seek  into&quot;)  and<br>
   exquisite,  which  describes  something  that  is &quot;sought out&quot;<br>
   (ex-, &quot;out&quot;) because of beauty, delicacy, or perfection.<br>

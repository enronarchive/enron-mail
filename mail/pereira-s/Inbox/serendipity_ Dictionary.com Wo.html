   Word of the Day for Thursday October 18, 2001:<br>
<br>
   serendipity \sehr-uhn-DIP-uh-tee\, noun:<br>
   The  faculty  or  phenomenon  of  making  fortunate accidental<br>
   discoveries.<br>
<br>
     Still,  I  was more subject to serendipity than I yet knew.<br>
     Soon  risk, chance, and a letter from Sir Alun Reese-Jones,<br>
     the Master of Trinity, my college at Cambridge, were to set<br>
     my life on an adventurous course.<br>
     --David Freeman, One of Us<br>
<br>
     Yet even as I planned a rough route, leaving plenty of room<br>
     for  serendipity,  I  was uncomfortably aware that journeys<br>
     have a way of creating their own momentum.<br>
     --Lesley  Hazleton,  [1]Driving  To  Detroit: An Automotive<br>
     Odyssey<br>
<br>
     There   again,   perhaps  because  of  serendipity,  or  an<br>
     especially  conscientious  team  of  doctors,  it  can also<br>
     happen  that the crucial clues are noticed and recorded for<br>
     posterity.<br>
     --Edward  Hooper,  [2]The River: A Journey to the Source of<br>
     HIV and AIDS<br>

<br>
   The  word  serendipity  was  formed  by  English author Horace<br>
   Walpole (1717-1797) from Serendip (also Serendib), an old name<br>
   for  Sri  Lanka,  in  reference  to  a Persian tale, The Three<br>
   Princes   of   Serendip,   whose   heroes  &quot;discovered,  quite<br>
   unexpectedly, great and wonderful good in the most unlikely of<br>
   situations, places and people.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Serendipitous    describes   that   which   is   obtained   or<br>
   characterized by serendipity.<br>

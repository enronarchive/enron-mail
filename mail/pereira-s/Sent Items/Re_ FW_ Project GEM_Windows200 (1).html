Subject: FW: Project GEM/Windows2000 Deployment Migration<br>
<br>
<br>
I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to <br>
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well <br>
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of <br>
upgrading to this newer operating system.<br>
 <br>
Along with upgrading the O/S, Enron has also took the initiative to move over <br>
to Microsoft Outlook2000, for our messaging client.  This will provide more <br>
flexibility and ease-of-use for e-mail, calendars, contacts -- not to mention <br>
an easier medium to synchronize data to your handheld devices.<br>
 <br>
I would like to start the migration process first with visiting with each of <br>
you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more than 10-15min.  <br>
Profiling can begin as early as tomorrow (4/17/01) - so here is what I ask of <br>
you:<br>
 <br>
*** Please reply to this e-mail with a date/time that I can stop by.  Being <br>
that most of you sit in the same, general location - I'm hoping this <br>
profiling process should take no more than a few days. ***<br>
 <br>
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific <br>
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT <br>
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>

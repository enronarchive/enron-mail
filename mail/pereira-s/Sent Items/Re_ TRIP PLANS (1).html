That sounds great!!  We're looking forward to the trip as well.  The kids are <br>
anxious to have Alexia and Sebastien here to play with.  I don't know if <br>
there are any activities in particular that Alexia and Sebastien want to do, <br>
but I know Kali and Michael would be happy just to play at home and swim.  <br>
Mayba a movie or two.  By the way, we just saw Spy Kids for the second time.  <br>
If it's playing down there, you ought to take the kids.  Alexia will <br>
especially enjoy it.<br>
<br>
See you soon.<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
<br>

Hi Susan,<br>
˜˜˜ How's it going?˜ I  firmed up everything with the travel agent <br>
yesterday.˜ I still don't have a  price to give you because the hotel hasn't <br>
set one yet for the ground portion  (that's life in Brazil!), but it will be <br>
somewhere in the range that I had said  earlier.˜ <br>
˜˜˜ Everything is all set and  reserved, and as soon as we have a price I'll <br>
purchase them.˜ So for the  time being don't worry about writing a check and <br>
I'll get back with you when  it's all finalized.˜ I'm really looking forward <br>
to having the kids return  with us and having you guys come down...it's going <br>
to be a lot of  fun!<br>
˜˜˜ Talk with you  soon..............Jan<br>
<br>

Just want you to know I received and checked your  paperwork.˜ It's nice to <br>
get a head start on things, thanks!˜ I did  not find a T5 - which is OK as <br>
long as you hadn't turned one in with cash and I  missed it.<br>
˜<br>
I did make a minor adjustment which you'll need to  know about when <br>
distributing the recognitions.˜ The donated box of cookies  had to be to be <br>
assigned to a girl, so I gave it to Kendra Muecke.˜ She  originally sold 49, <br>
and with the extra box, she is at the level to receive the  patch and face <br>
stickers. You'll get the extra patch and stickers kit with your  stuff in May.<br>

I left my paperwork in the green box at your  doorstep yesterday.˜ I wanted<br>
to make sure you received it.˜ I'll  be out of town until March 25, so if<br>
you have any questions, I won't be  able to respond until then.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

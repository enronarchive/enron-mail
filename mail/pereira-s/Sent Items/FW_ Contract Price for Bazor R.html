I don't think anything has changed.  The transport rate is $.2421 + 0.3% fuel.  The pricing is the average + $.01.  I've emailed Tricia to see what the problem is.<br>

Susan,<br>
<br>
We have received our statement for September and the price has changed from<br>
our original contract and what we have previously been paid.  The statement<br>
shows that we are being paid three different amounts for various volumes,<br>
rather than the average of the three prices plus $.01.  I have spoken with<br>
Tricia Truong and she suggest I speak to you.<br>
<br>
Also the transportation has changed on the statement.  Has this changed?<br>
<br>
Is something in error or has the contract changed?<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>

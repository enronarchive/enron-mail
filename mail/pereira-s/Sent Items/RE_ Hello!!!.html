Still here, but don't know for how long...<br>
<br>
I still can't believe the arrogant assholes who have run this company into the ground.  Because our credit rating keeps dropping, our trading abilities are being adversely affected.  I don't know how long things will be able to go on at this rate.  We may not make it to the end of the year, Dynegy deal or not.  I'm hopeful that the remaining finance people can refinance our debt, but if they don't, it doesn't look good....<br>
<br>
Oh, well.  We'll all just move on and look for other jobs.  <br>
<br>
Oh, by the way, we just moved into the new building this past weekend.  We're sitting near the power trading arrogant assholes.<br>
<br>
Hope everything is going well for you.  How is your house coming along??  Send me a note back.  I'm going to be out tomorrow but will be back in on Monday.  They start laying off people next week.  It won't be in gas and power, but in other areas of the corporation.  Merry Christmas!!<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
<br>

I reconciled the imbalance between Stingray and LRP, but as to who approached <br>
who first, I don't remember.  It was my job to resolve all imbalance <br>
discrepancies on LRP, and then give my findings to commercial.  As I was <br>
working with Sherryl Cranford at Stingray, she made it clear that they were <br>
anxious to get the imbalances resolved and settled as well, and that was the <br>
only imbalance we discussed.  I think Sherryl and I agreed to that imbalance <br>
sometime in september.  Whether or not they've been asking for the gas back <br>
since February, I don't know because I didn't deal with LRP companies until <br>
several months later.<br>

When did we agree with El Paso/Stingray on the 11,973 dth owed to Stingray?  <br>
Have they been asking for this gas back since February?  Did you approach <br>
them first on settling this?  The reason I'm asking these questions is that <br>
HPL had a big imbalance due them from an El Paso operated line in Texas.  HPL <br>
had been asking for the gas back from the beginning and El Paso finally paid <br>
them back in kind this month.  I do not want to pay Stingray back in kind.  I <br>
want to pay them Feb. 2000 IF NGPL-LA.<br>

Thanks,<br>

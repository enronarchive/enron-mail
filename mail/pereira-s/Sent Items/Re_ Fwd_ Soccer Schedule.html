Thursdays at 6:30 will generally work for us; however, on Thursday the 15th <br>
we unfortunately have a conflict.  Can you send me the list of girls who are <br>
on the team?  I know Kali is curious whether she knows anyone or not. <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

We finally have our practice time for Spring Soccer! It is Thursday form <br>
6:30  <br>
until 7:40pm at Pershing on the large field. I understand that there will be  <br>
one other U-8 girls team there with us and that there will be a trainer. I  <br>
think the games may start on Sunday, Feb 18th but that is not confirmed yet.  <br>
But our first practices with be on Thursday, Feb15th! We can't wait to meet  <br>
all of the girls! Kathy Harrison and Roy Pruden<br>

Sorry for delay, it's been real busy.˜ On the practice schedules, the only <br>
switch I have made is to put the 2˜ 7:40 sessions back to 5:30 to 6:30.˜ <br>
Assuming they will have smaller attendance, I am asking Nebo to only schedule <br>
1 trainer for each session.˜ We will plan on using half of the Pershing <br>
middle field unless the Pershing Large field is empty. <br>
<br>
See how this works, I am putting this into effect with Nebo's trainers unless <br>
I hear any objections by tomorrow evening.˜ Let's plan on charging $40 per <br>
player for the Spring, no matter how many sessions they attend.˜ And remind <br>
them that they can attend any day or session if they miss theirs.˜ If any get <br>
too crowded, we'll adjust the trainer situation. <br>
<br>
M˜ -˜˜ U-6˜˜ 5 teams 30 kids Pershing Large 6:30-7:40˜˜ 2 trainers <br>
T˜˜ -˜˜ U-7B˜ 3 teams 18 kids possibly 1 U-8˜ 7-8 kids˜ Pershing L 6:30-7:40 <br>
2 trainers <br>
T˜ -˜˜ U-8G˜ 2 teams 20 girls˜ Pershing Middle 5:30-6:30˜ 1 Trainers <br>
W -˜˜ U-6˜ 2 teams 12 kids U-7 G 4 teams 24 girls Pershing L 6:30-7:40˜ 2 <br>

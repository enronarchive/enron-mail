I think I am signed up as an alternate for the field trip on Thursday.  Do you know if I'll be needed?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Subject:	Kindergarten teacher gifts for Christmas<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello -<br>
 <br>
Part of our $15.00 homeroom fee that you paid at the beginning  of the school year is used to purchase gifts for the teachers at  Christmas.  Michael Davies encouraged the room moms to think of something  that the children could participate in and make for the teachers.  Families  are welcome to give individual gifts as well, if they want.<br>
 <br>
Our class will be making/painting a ceramic piece, one for  Mrs. Munford and one for Mrs. Thuot.  I am going to pick out a piece this  weekend at the Mad Potter - it will either be a platter or a flower pot that I  will then fill with a plant for each of them.  If you have any preferences  or thoughts on what our piece should be, please let me know right  away.<br>
 <br>
Once I pick out the piece, you will be able to take your child  to the Mad Potter, 1963A W. Gray (next to Fundamentally Toys and Mesa Grill,  just east of Shepherd).  They are open daily with hours that should be  convenient for working and non-working parents.  Their hours  are:<br>
 <br>
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday    11 a.m. - 10  p.m.<br>
Tuesday                                      11  a.m. - 6 p.m.<br>
Friday,  Saturday                           11  a.m. - 11 p.m.<br>
Sunday                                          1 p.m. - 6  p.m.<br>
 <br>
Your child will put a thumbprint on each piece in the paint  color of his/her choice.  You will need to write his/her name in pencil  underneath the thumbprint and we will paint their names in before the piece is  fired.  I will make something (hopefully a dalmation) out of their  thumbprints.  If anyone is artistic and would like to help, I would welcome  their help.<br>
 <br>
The pieces need to be fired by Monday, December 10 in order  for me to pick them up before the class Christmas party on December  18.<br>
 <br>
Please plan on taking your child to the Mad Potter one  day between Monday, December 3 and Sunday, December 9 to do their  thumbprints.  You will not be charged anything, and anyone in the  studio will be able to help you.  They will have the piece and written  instructions from me, along with a list of the class members.<br>
 <br>
If you have any questions or comments, please call me at  713-626-9726 or email me.  I know we are all busy at this time of year, so  I appreciate your cooperation in getting this done next week.   Thanks!  <br>
 <br>

P.S.  Please respond to this email so I know you have  received it.  Thank you.<br>

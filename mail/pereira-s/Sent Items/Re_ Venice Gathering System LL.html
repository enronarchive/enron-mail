In the past, Jesse would let me know about our imbalance and cashout price.  <br>
He would do the paperwork and trade out of the imbalance with another party.<br>

Susan, Are you interested in imbalance trading for VGS?<br>

Brenda,<br>
Victor and I totally agree with you.  With the increase of wellhead <br>
production and swings that we are seeing, we are totally revisiting the way <br>
we handle wellhead.  Beginning with March we will be taking a closer look at <br>
what our production is doing and will enter appropriate cash out tickets on <br>
Venice.  <br>
<br>
Just to let you know, we are going through the process of looking at wellhead <br>
production on all our pipes and at what is the best method to handle.  <br>
<br>

Venice invoices for cashout on a one month lag.  The February invoice cashed <br>
out the January  volume of &lt;19,385&gt; at $6.8121 for a total credit of <br>
$132,052.55.  The imbalance for February production is  &lt;4455&gt; and to trade <br>
the imbalances, VGS must be notified in writing on or before the 25th of <br>
March.<br>
<br>
There are no cashout tickets for VGS on the CPR cashout reports that I ran <br>
for January and February production.  From looking back at several months of <br>
invoices, we appear to get cashed out every month.  Would it be possible to <br>
have cashout tickets entered for VGS?<br>
<br>
If you have see any problems with the imbalance volumes reflected on the <br>
invoice, please let me know. <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

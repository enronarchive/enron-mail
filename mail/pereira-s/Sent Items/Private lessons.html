Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car <br>
trouble.  By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and <br>
including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.  That would allow for 3 <br>
additional private lessons.  What days and times will work over the next few <br>
weeks?  Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.  After school <br>
during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

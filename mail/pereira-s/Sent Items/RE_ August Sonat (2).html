Susan, because of the way these deals are in the system, I had to shortpay Superior approx $28K for last month.  Per volume management, they cannot actualize the deals in the order listed below because meter PSNG1220 is not on deals 778088 and 939542 (days 3 &amp; 4 specifically).  Can you make this change so that Vol Mgmt can actualize?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
Laurie<br>

Superior is right.  One of the deals listed as baseload was really term.  Christina is going to adjust the tickets.  Fill deals 778088 and 933354 first, then 939542, then the gda deal 939300.  Sorry for the confusion.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Susan, this the order that Superior says the August deals should be filled in.  Can you please review the email below with the spreadsheet I sent earlier and let me know.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

Thanks!!!  We agree on the ENA Upstream gas but the rest of the gas needs to<br>
be reallocated.  According to my trader, the deals should be filled in the<br>
following order:<br>
<br>
Trigger:	 	 5,000/day   @ $4.425   ENA Deal # 778088<br>
EFP:    		12,903/day  @ $2.895   ENA Deal # 933354<br>
Baseload:  	2,000/day    @ $3.10     ENA Deal # 939542<br>
Swing:   		      @ GDA      ENA Deal # 939300<br>
<br>
Please let me know if this is not the order that your trader agrees with.<br>

Jenna, this is what we show in our system for Sonat.  I know it is not<br>
right, but I wanted you to have the detail regardless.  I am going to<br>
get with the trader to see exactly how the volume should be allocated.<br>
I'll let you know what I find.<br>

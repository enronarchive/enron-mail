<br>
Could not agree more and carried that argument during the meeting in<br>
which the proposed plans were presented at Council.  Other than Marilyn<br>
Griffin, I received no vocal support or indications of such from the<br>
other members including the mayor.  I hope your comments are sent to<br>
them as well.<br>
<br>
I would also encourage you to closely examine the proposed changes to<br>
Colonial Park (a nuance transformation from a Community Park to a<br>
Neighborhood Park) and cost.<br>
<br>
With the YMCA coming into city ownership next year, there should be no<br>
problem with INDEFINITELY postponing construction at Colonial Park until<br>
youth activities currently ongoing at Colonial can be transferred to the<br>
YMCA.<br>
<br>
thanks,<br>

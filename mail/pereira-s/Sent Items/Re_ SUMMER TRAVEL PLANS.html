Hi Susan,<br>
    I would think that 2 nights , 3 days is plenty for Rio.  We could arrive<br>
Sunday  see Corcovado, P’o de AØucar, Tijuca rainforrest, and a few outlying<br>
beaches.  Then late Tuesday afternoon the 10th you and Renato could fly out<br>
for Foz.  Depending on the flight schedules you may have to wait until early<br>
Wednesday morning the 11th. I think that Tuesday would be better so you're<br>
not feeling rushed, but we'll see what flight times are offered.  Spend two<br>
nights at Foz and fly into SP late Thursday evening the 12th.  Hang around<br>
the house on Friday, put your suitcases together and head back for Houston<br>
that evening.<br>
    Too bad you're not able to spend more time here, but given what time you<br>
have I think you'll be seeing the two most interesting places in Brazil. All<br>
of the others, Amazon, Pantanal, Bahia all take so much travel time to get<br>
there that it's not even really worth the attempt to see them.   If you do<br>
decide on Foz, don't mess with packing your coats, it'll be easier to borrow<br>
some of ours.<br>
    The travel agent is looking at fares, etc. so I'll let you know what she<br>
finds.<br>
I'll be in touch.............Jan<br>

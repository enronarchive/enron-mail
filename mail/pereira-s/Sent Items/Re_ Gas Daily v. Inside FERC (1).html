We are getting very close to the start up of the Bazor Ridge plant.. When I<br>
talked to you Friday, you were going to request that Stacy &quot;generate the<br>
paper&quot;.  Has this been done yet?  The invoicing does not appear to be an<br>
issue any more, our controller would like us to invoice Enron and Rebel to<br>
invoice EOTT on all products.  Also, I am assuming that you changed the<br>
September pricing to Gas Daily, as you implied below, on August 25.  Right<br>
now we are looking at a start up on the last 10 days or so of September.<br>
<br>
If there are problems with any of the above, please call me a soon as you<br>
can today at (601)969-1568.  I will be out the rest of the week.  If<br>
anything comes up after today please contact Dan Cole at the same number.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>

I've been trying to get in touch with our attorney Stacy Dickson to see if<br>
the confirmation is signed.  The last version of the confirmation reflected<br>
gas daily pricing for August and index pricing for Sept, Oct and Nov.  I<br>
think we will need to amend this if the time periods are going to be<br>
different.<br>
<br>
I'll let you know when I hear back from Stacy.<br>

As I understand it (which could be dangerous), if it comes on in 1st, 2nd<br>
week of September we have to use Gas Daily, is this correct?  Our comtract<br>
calls for the time period to be 3 months, after the 1st day following the<br>
first month of production.  This would carry the contract through,<br>
December.<br>
<br>
Also, the operator of Destin pipeline is still telling the operator of the<br>
well that Enron does not have a shipping agreement in place.  I have told<br>
them that Enon is telling us they are ready to recieve.<br>

Do you want to change the contract to reflect Gas Daily pricing for<br>
September and Inside FERC pricing effective Oct &amp; Nov?<br>

EOTT driver training has been rescheduled for the mornings of 9/5 and 9/6.<br>
DuFore driver training has been rescheduled to the afternoon of 9/5.  I<br>
expect to have residue gas for sale between 9/2 and 9/6, depending on how<br>
well plant commissioning goes.<br>
<br>
Let me know if you require any additional information.<br>

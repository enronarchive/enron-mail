Hi, fellow P&amp;Z members.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to let you know about the meeting David Moss and I had with Dan Muniza of Center America.  Sweet Mesquite restaurant is very interested in the existing Eckerd's site and is now willing to wait until next summer when Eckerd's moves into its new proposed building on the west side of the property (where Weiner's is now).  Sweet Mesquite expressed an interest in some outdoor seating area and Dan Muniza wanted some warm fuzzies that the City would allow Center America/Sweet Mesquite to use City easement  along Braes for a patio area.  Currently, that area is being used for parking.  The proposed patio would be above the street level by around two feet or so.  Basically, Center America would extend the existing sidewalk that abuts Eckerd's out to the street and fence in the whole patio area with decorative fencing or brick.  They would also include some plantings, greenery, etc.  David Moss is checking with David Allums (city attorney) about any potential liability with Center America/Sweet Mesquite using City easement.  Also, there is an existing water line under this parking area that would need to be relocated closer to the street.  I think David will be able to give us a cost estimate on this at our next meeting.  David did mention that the line is in need of replacement anyway.<br>
<br>
As for the new Eckerd's building, Dan Muniza did not have the proposed elevations from Eckerd's yet.  He's expecting to get something this week.  He's reserving the right to pick something that will blend in with the existing center.<br>
<br>
Also, there was some concern at the last City Council meeting about the additional parking needs of a Sweet Mesquite.  Dan Muniza indicated that the parking behind the center is open to anyone.  They prefer that it be available for Center America employees and tenants during the day, but it's wide open after 5 pm.<br>
<br>
David Moss will be contacting everyone soon about scheduling a meeting to discuss the City's proposed landscaping ordinance.  He wanted to do that prior to Comp. Plan meeting on the 30th.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

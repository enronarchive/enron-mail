Oh, Susan, I can't believe that ENE is trading soooo low!  I am so sorry for<br>
all of you there, hopefully a miracle will happen.  But you REALLY didn't<br>
want to retire, did you?  You're WAY too young!  The bad thing about<br>
marrying a man so much younger is, I probably won't retire until he does and<br>
that may be awhile since we just started our own business this year and he's<br>
only 31.  I don#t want anyone else being the CFO of MY company, but ME!  But<br>
the good thing is having a full time cook/maid.<br>
<br>
Well, I heard this morning that they are expecting more terrorist attacks<br>
this week.  You all take care.  Are people that work at Enron flying as much<br>
as they used too?<br>
<br>
Well, I hate to hear that things are up in the air for Renato right now, but<br>
sounds like he got a great package.  He will find something good in no time,<br>
I'm sure..then you just have all that extra money!<br>
<br>
We have some American guests visiting, my sister-in-law's, cousin's, 2 sons.<br>
They are really nice guys, 19 and 21 and they have been soooo lucky with the<br>
weather.  It's great!  Sunshine and warm, well warm for us...like 65Â°.  All<br>
the leaves are turning right now, I hope the sunshine lasts a few more days.<br>
They are off touring around town right now, there's so much to see right<br>
here alone, then later in the week they are headed further south to see more<br>
castles and stuff.<br>
<br>
Well I have to go get some work done.  Hope things start looking up over<br>
there SOON for you all!<br>
<br>
Later,<br>
connie<br>

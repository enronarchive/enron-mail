Susan,<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all your help.  This is the first team that I have ever been involved with that had the asst. coaches get to 100% of the practices. Also, thanks for standing in for me when I had to miss the last couple of games. You did a great job. Maybe if we get a Spring team we could exchange places, and you could   take over as the coach.  I would help you out when I could, and maybe Jon could, too.<br>
<br>
I hope you,Kali, Renato and Michael have a happy Thanksgiving.<br>
<br>
Terry Lester<br>

&gt; I just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the<br>
&gt; autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate.  I really<br>
&gt; appreciate it.  I had a lot of fun working with the girls.  They were<br>
&gt; all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.  It was very<br>
&gt; rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so<br>
&gt; much.  The girls have a lot to be proud of.  I hope to see everyone in<br>
&gt; the spring soccer program or next fall.  Thanks again to all the<br>
&gt; parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon<br>
&gt; and Vicki.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Have a great holiday season.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Take care,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Susan Pereira<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; P.S. - Terry, could you forward this on to the Reeses, please?  I<br>
&gt; don't have their email address.  Thanks.<br>

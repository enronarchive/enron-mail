I just wanted to thank all the girls and the parents for the autographed t-shirt and the restaurant gift certificate.  I really appreciate it.  I had a lot of fun working with the girls.  They were all so enthusiastic and committed to the team effort.  It was very rewarding for me to see how the team came together and improved so much.  The girls have a lot to be proud of.  I hope to see everyone in the spring soccer program or next fall.  Thanks again to all the parents for your efforts and time commitment, especially to Terry, Jon and Vicki.<br>
<br>
Have a great holiday season.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
<br>

P.S. - Terry, could you forward this on to the Reeses, please?  I don't have their email address.  Thanks.<br>

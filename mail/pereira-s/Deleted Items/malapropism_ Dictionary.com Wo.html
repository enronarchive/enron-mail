   Word of the Day for Monday November 26, 2001:<br>
<br>
   malapropism \mal-uh-PROP-iz-uhm\, noun:<br>
   The   usually  unintentionally  humorous  misuse  of  a  word,<br>
   especially  by  confusion  with one of similar sound; also, an<br>
   example of such misuse.<br>
<br>
     At  15,  Rachel, the whiny would-be beauty queen who &quot;cares<br>
     for  naught  but  appearances,&quot;  can think only of what she<br>
     misses:  the  five-day  deodorant pads she forgot to bring,<br>
     flush  toilets, machine-washed clothes and other things, as<br>
     she  says  with  her willful gift for malapropism, that she<br>
     has taken &quot;for granite.&quot;<br>
     --Michiko  Kakutani,  &quot;'The  Poisonwood  Bible': A Family a<br>
     Heart of Darkness,&quot; [1]New York Times, October 16, 1998<br>
<br>
     He  also  had, as a former colleague puts it, &quot;a photogenic<br>
     memory&quot;--a  malapropism  that  captures  his  gift  for the<br>
     social  side  of  life,  his Clintonian ability to remember<br>
     names of countless people he has met only briefly.<br>
     --Eric Pooley and S.C. Gwynne, &quot;How George Got His Groove,&quot;<br>
     [2]Time, June 21, 1999<br>
     _________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
   A  malapropism  is  so called after Mrs. Malaprop, a character<br>
   noted  for  her  amusing  misuse  of words in Richard Brinsley<br>
   Sheridan's comedy [3]The Rivals.<br>

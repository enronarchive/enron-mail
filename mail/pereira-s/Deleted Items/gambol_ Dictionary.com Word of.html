   Word of the Day for Tuesday December 11, 2001:<br>
<br>
   gambol \GAM-buhl\, intransitive verb:<br>
   To dance and skip about in play; to frolic.<br>
<br>
   noun:<br>
   A skipping or leaping about in frolic.<br>
<br>
     I've  been  told  dolphins  like  to gambol in the waves in<br>
     these waters, and that sighting them brings good luck.<br>
     --Barbara  Kingsolver, &quot;Where the Map Stopped,&quot; [1]New York<br>
     Times, May 17, 1992<br>
<br>
     The  bad  news  is that while most of us gambol in the sun,<br>
     there will be much wringing of hands in environment-hugging<br>
     circles about global warming and climate change.<br>
     --Derek Brown, &quot;Heatwaves,&quot; [2]The Guardian, June 16, 2000<br>
<br>
     Then they joined hands (it was the stranger who began it by<br>
     catching  Martha  and  Matilda) and danced the table round,<br>
     shaking  their  feet  and tossing their arms, the glee ever<br>
     more  uproarious,  --  danced  until  they were breathless,<br>
     every  one of them, save little Sammy, who was not asked to<br>
     join  the gambol, but sat still in his chair, and seemed to<br>
     expect no invitation.<br>
     --Norman  Duncan,  &quot;Santa  Claus  At  Lonely  Cove,&quot; [3]The<br>
     Atlantic, December 1903<br>

   Gambol,  earlier  gambolde  or  gambalde,  comes from Medieval<br>
   French  gambade,  &quot;a  leaping  or  skipping,&quot;  from Late Latin<br>
   gamba, &quot;hock (of a horse), leg,&quot; from Greek kampe, &quot;a joint or<br>
   bend.&quot;<br>
